<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<hr class="chap">

<p>I offer, at length, to the public the narrative of my travels in
the interior of Africa, which should have appeared long since;
several causes have, however, concurred during the fifteen months
that have elapsed since my return to my native soil, to retard its
publication till the present time. I have brought home, from the
regions I have traversed, only fugitive and very laconic notes,
written in haste and trepidation: they would have been inexorable
evidences against me, had I been surprised tracing unknown
characters, and unveiling as it were to the Whites the mysteries of
these countries. In Africa, especially in those districts occupied
by the Foulahs and the Moors, religious hypocrisy in a stranger is
the most flagrant of outrages, and it were a hundred times better
to pass there for a Christian, than for a false Mahometan; so that
if my mode of travelling had its advantages, which its success has
proved, it was also attended with terrible inconveniences. I
carried always in my wallet a sentence of death, and how often was
that wallet necessarily confided to the hands of enemies! On my
arrival in Paris, the notes, written mostly in pencil, were found
so faint and so much effaced by time, my wanderings, and my ill
fortune, that it required all the tenacity and the scrupulous
fidelity of my memory to restore and reproduce them as the basis of
my observations and the materials of my narrative.</p>

<p>But that scrupulous fidelity which should always distinguish the
compilation of travels, and which I consider the principal merit of
mine, demanded that I should consecrate to this work the time
necessary to ascertain that I have omitted nothing essential, and
to arrange the facts in the exact order in which I had observed and
noted them. Another not less legitimate cause of delay arose from a
long and dangerous illness which seized me some months after my
arrival in France, and exhausted the strength which was left me by
the long continued fatigues and privations of a seventeen months’
journey over those burning sands so frequently fatal to our
European travellers. To these causes must also be added the extent
of my materials, my want of initiation into the art of composition
in the most difficult and delicate of languages, and the resolution
I had formed to avoid having recourse to a more experienced pen,
except for the correction of those errors of style which would
naturally escape mine; for I was desirous of offering to the public
a composition as entirely my own as the observations on which it
was founded; a composition which, however deficient in studied
elegance, should at least be simple, clear, and frank, describing
the exact extent of my travels and exhibiting the traveller under
his peculiar traits. With regret I acknowledge that important
observations upon the political and religious institutions, and
upon the manners and customs of the people amongst whom I have
sojourned, will not be found here; even had my prior studies
directed my mind to this species of reflections, the scanty
resources at my disposal, and the consequent necessity of a rapid
passage, did not permit my residence in any place for a sufficient
length of time to furnish a solid foundation for such researches.
My principal object was to collect carefully and accurately all the
facts, of whatsoever nature, which fell under my inspection, and
especially to notice whatever appeared conducive to the improvement
of geography and of our commerce with Africa.</p>

<p>A long stay in our establishments of Senegal, and perhaps also,
my own experience, had taught me how much this commerce, which, had
so long languished, needed new markets and new connections in the
interior; but to form these new connections, to impose on the
distant population a tribute to our industry, new discoveries were
necessary; and increased geographical knowledge was indispensable
to enable the government to extend sufficient encouragement to our
mercantile establishments on the coast. A strong persuasion of this
necessity, of this urgent need, under which our African commerce
labours, became in a manner the soul of my inquiries, particularly
in a certain portion of my travels. I was convinced that our
colonial and all our commercial relations must sooner or later be
powerfully influenced by clear and positive information, drawn from
the fountain head, and deposited with the government of a king, the
zealous and enlightened protector of interests so important, and so
nearly affecting, at the present period, the prosperity, and
perhaps even, the internal tranquillity of the kingdom.</p>

<p>Have I been fortunate enough to realize in this respect the
wishes I had formed, the hopes which, in common with my former
compatriots of Senegal, I had dared to conceive, of fulfilling this
part of the task which I undertook, and of thus paying my tribute
to the government of my country? Let my natural judges, with whom
the fruits of my researches are deposited, and let the success of
future enterprizes, incited by mine, answer this question for me.
It is not for me to estimate the progress which geographical and
natural science may owe to my travels. I must leave it to be
appreciated by those who so worthily represent them in the capital
of the civilized world, and the possession of whose knowledge and
talents would have been so delightful, and above all so useful to
me, when day after day I found myself alone and left to my own
feeble resources in a world as yet unknown to, and unexplored by
curious and scientific Europe. Armed with the knowledge and the
instruments for which we are indebted to them, I might have hoped
to have more fully accomplished the wishes of the Geographical
Society, and to have rendered myself more deserving of the
flattering and benevolent reception which it has granted me, and of
the distinction and rewards which its descriminating patriotism
decrees to those who record its efforts; of that Society which,
with so much zeal and success, prosecutes the extension of science,
and which, by the encouragement it held out to those who should
explore the central regions of Africa, confirmed my opinion of the
importance of such travels, and determined me in the plan which I
had already formed of one day attempting the discovery of
Timbuctoo.</p>

<p>In paying this just homage to the Geographical Society, I must
not omit one of its most distinguished members, M. Jomard,
President of the Central Committee and Member of the Institute,
who, since my arrival in France, has without intermission honoured
me with his valuable advice and his personal kindness, who has not
disdained to unite his name with mine, and has so largely
contributed to any success with which this narrative may be
honoured, by enriching it with a map founded upon my notes, and
with geographical disquisitions upon a continent, the study of
which has long been familiar to him, both as a traveller and as a
writer. I request him to accept this public testimony of my warmest
gratitude.</p>

<p>About half past nine o’clock we left the port. We did not waste
much time in adieus; my friends saw me on board, wished me a safe
voyage, and departed exclaiming: <i>Salam alécoom, Abdallah</i>.
The sherif, with whom the gift of my umbrella rendered me such a
favourite, directed me to his correspondent at Timbuctoo, to whom
he particularly recommended me in a letter, which he sent by the
superintendent of the cargo. I had reason to be grateful for his
kind foresight, to which I was indebted for the friendly reception
I experienced on my arrival in the capital of the Western
Soudan.</p>

<p>Though the heat was beginning to be exceedingly oppressive, I
remained on deck, for the canoe was very full. The river makes
several windings; its course is rapid; and as it is extremely
shallow, we were obliged several times to unload the vessel in
order to pass over the sandbanks. The negroes in the neighbourhood
helped to load and unload the canoe, and to push it forward; all
this, of course, occasioned considerable delay.</p>

<p>About two o’clock we reached the majestic Dhioliba, which flows
slowly from W. N. W. At this part it is very deep, and about three
times the width of the Seine at the Pont-Neuf. It takes a turn of
about two miles to the south; its banks are low and very barren.
The distance from Jenné to this river is, I should imagine, about
ten miles. After flowing two miles to the southward, it turns to
the N. N. E. About four o’clock we arrived at Cougalia, where I had
previously crossed the river. Aided by the current I suppose we
made about two miles an hour.</p>

<p>A little before sun-set we passed Kera, a pretty little village
on the right bank of the river, containing about three hundred
inhabitants. It is nearly seven miles from Cougalia. Here the river
turns to the N. E. A little to the left there is a small island
submerged during the inundation The river is much wider here than
at Cougalia, and it is quite as deep. On the plain I observed some
slaves tilling the ground; they had pickaxes like those of the
Bambaras. We continued our course till near midnight. As I had no
compass I observed the direction of our course during the night by
the polar star. In the evening we stood to the N. E., still going
at the rate of about two miles an hour.</p>

<p>When we lay to, the negroes who had the management of the canoe
sought to pick a quarrel with me: they would not allow me to sleep
on board. They told me that I had given them nothing, and that if I
did not pay them they would put me on shore. I saw very well that
their only object was to intimidate me and thereby to extort
something from me. I disregarded their threats, and prepared to
sleep on board in spite of them, for the cold night air and the
damp were very unpleasant. I arranged my resting place as well as I
could on a heap of baggage, where I was almost folded double and
unable to move. I had not a wink of sleep during the whole night,
and the negroes annoyed me in every possible way to induce me to
leave the canoe. They even began to address insulting language to
me, and threatened to put me on shore next day if I did not satisfy
their demands. I suffered much from this annoyance; but the negroes
gained nothing by their insolence. When the common people of these
countries meet with a stranger who does not speak their language,
they think they may insult him with impunity; but it is sufficient
to shew firmness to make them more tractable. They gave me for
supper a little rice boiled in water, which was the food of the
slaves. I had not eaten any thing all day, for there was no
possibility of cooking on account of the crowded state of the
canoe.</p>

<p>At four in the morning of the 24th of March we stood to the N.
E. The sailors pushed forward the canoe with a long pole: they
rowed it in deep water, and sometimes towed it along shore.</p>

<p>At this part, the river is about half a mile broad and very
deep. Its banks, though low, are adorned with a species of mimosa,
which grows only to the height of a small shrub. About seven in the
morning we stopped before the village of Soufara, situated on the
right bank, on a height which preserves it from the inundation.
Beside this village is little stream, which runs in an eastward
direction. We went ashore to purchase some maumies and
pistachio-nuts for breakfast. In this place there is no regular
market; but people go through the streets selling pistachios, and
other little productions of the country. The village probably
contains about two hundred and fifty inhabitants. They live in
wretched huts, built of earth like those of the Bambaras, which do
not approach the perfection of the habitations of Jenné. The people
catch a great quantity of fish. They generally use nets made of
cotton, but sometimes fish with the line. When I returned on board
the canoe, the negro who was the master of the slaves and
superintendent of the cargo gave me a piece of cake for my
breakfast. Fortunately I had provided myself with some on shore,
otherwise I should have made a sorry repast. The negroes again
importuned me for cowries; but I persisted in my resolution to give
them nothing. At half past seven we continued our course. The river
now took a northerly direction. It continued wide, and its depth
was about ten or twelve feet. This I ascertained by observing the
long pole with which the sailors pushed the canoe. It was nearly
eleven o’clock when we passed Cabia. In front of this village there
are three little islands; here the river takes a turn to the N. E.
and becomes narrower. About two o’clock I observed its direction
was north, and at half past three, north-east. Its width and depth
continued much the same; its banks were barren and low. On both
sides I observed immense plains, the uniformity of which was broken
only by some ronniers which rise majestically to the height of
about eighty feet from the ground and bound the horizon. About five
in the afternoon we perceived the village of Taco, which is
situated on the left bank.</p>

<p>At sun-set I discerned, in the direction of the east, two little
hills about six miles from the bank of the river, which in this
part runs to the north. About seven in the evening we stopped
before the village of Coona, which is inhabited by Foulahs, who
live in straw huts. In the port there were some canoes, all going
to Timbuctoo. Here we could plainly perceive the two hills I have
just mentioned, and a little to the north-east were three others of
similar height. We passed the night in this village, which, like
Taco, is situated on the left bank.</p>

<p>On the 25th of March I was informed that the great canoe which
was to convey us to Timbuctoo was in the port and ready for our
reception. It was covered with mats, and laden with rice, millet,
cotton, honey, vegetable butter, and other productions of the
country. The canoe appeared to me very fragile; like the smaller
ones its planks were joined with cords; its burthen was about sixty
tons.</p>

<p>We were occupied all day in getting the merchandise from the
small canoe, and putting it on board the large one. There was on
the shore a great concourse of people, all engaged in some kind of
labour; they had pitched tents to shelter themselves from the heat,
which was excessive. The negroes offered us their merchandise for
sale. On seeing them I almost imagined myself in a market on the
banks of the Senegal. The village is situated on a little eminence,
and is scantily shaded by ronniers and mimosas. The heat was
suffocating. I went to visit the market, which was very badly
provided; for it was then the time of the Ramadan: there was a
little milk, some pistachios, dry and fresh fish, maumies, and
other light articles of food. The people looked at me with
indifference. The young girls, who offered their merchandise for
sale, had a very pleasing mode of address; but I bought nothing, on
account of the presence of the Foulahs, who are even more fanatical
than the Moors, and who, if they had seen me eat, would have set me
down for an infidel. My hosts at Jenné had however made me promise
that I would not fast on my passage, observing that I could make up
by fasting at Timbuctoo for the number of days during which I might
neglect the practice of that religious duty. I sat down beneath a
tree on the bank of the river, and amused myself for a short time
by observing a group of young negroes of both sexes, who were
bathing, dancing and gamboling about in the water.</p>

<p>A little to the north of the village the river is intersected by
a sand-bank. This bank was covered by a multitude of water-fowl of
various kinds, whose white plumage looked like a sheet of snow in
the midst of the river. The channel for the passage of canoes is
near the right bank. The surrounding country is very barren: not a
single shrub is to be seen. The soil consists of immense marshes,
which are inundated at the swell of the waters. The shore on either
side is so extremely low that the river seems on the point of
overflowing its banks. In the village I met with a Moorish trader,
who was returning from Timbuctoo in a common canoe, laden with
salt. He told me that he had been a month on his way from Cabra to
Coona. I invited him to come on board our vessel and take a little
refreshment of dokhnou and water. Dokhnou, as I have before
observed, consists of a mixture of the flour of millet and honey,
which is afterwards mixed with water for drink. He requested me to
wait until sun-set on account of the Foulahs, who, if they saw us
drink, would have a bad opinion of us. He left me to take a turn in
the village, but I did not see him again.</p>

<p>In the port, there were many fishermen’s canoes. When the
fishermen catch their fish, either with the net or the line, they
dry it in the sun and sell it to the vessels which are continually
stopping in their port: they also carry it to Jenné for sale. At
two o’clock in the afternoon, I was informed that dinner was ready,
and was asked whether I would partake of it; for the slaves were
not required to fast, and I was ranked among them. That I might not
be observed by any one, I went on board the canoe to take my dinner
at my ease. It consisted of a little boiled millet-flour, without
any seasoning. After this frugal repast, the slaves were freed from
their chains, and I was gratified in witnessing the pleasure which
these poor creatures experienced during their temporary release
from bondage. They appeared perfectly happy. They tried to walk,
but it was with difficulty that they could move a few steps, for
the chains which they had worn since they left Jenné had wounded
their feet.</p>

<p>Having nothing more to detain us in the village, we left it in
the afternoon during a calm, taking a northern direction. The large
canoe did not get on so well as the small one which we had left
behind us, consequently we scarcely made two miles an hour.</p>

<p>About five o’clock we passed Taguetia, situated on the left
bank. In front of this village a marigot, or branch, about
twenty-five or thirty fathoms wide, runs off to the east. The
village of Sangouno is on one of the banks of this branch. At its
mouth are two little islands, about a quarter of a mile in
circumference, on which are some fishermen’s huts. The river still
continues of the same width, running to the north. It is very deep,
and its banks are low and barren.</p>

<p>At ten at night we stopped at Sankhaguibila. At this place the
river takes a turn to the east, and then to the north. The
inhabitants hold a little market, to which they bring milk and
dried fish, which the negroes of the canoes purchase, and pay for
in cowries, the only money current on the banks of the river as far
as Timbuctoo. People came from all sides with earthen pots,
calabashes, mats, and various other kinds of merchandise. This
village probably contains about four hundred inhabitants,
consisting of Foulahs, Mandingoes, and Bambaras from Jenné.</p>

<p>At three o’clock on the morning of the 26th, we quitted the
village of Sankhaguibila, the huts of which are all of straw, and
badly constructed. We advanced slowly to the west. At sun-rise we
found the river take a turn to the north. Its banks are adorned
with a few dwarf shrubs.</p>

<p>At four in the afternoon we passed Diébé, situated on the right
and before which there is a sand-bank. In general, all these
villages resemble each other. The population varies but little. We
stopped here nearly two hours to escape the north wind, which was
blowing furiously, and which, in all probability, would have
destroyed our frail bark. When it ceased we continued our course,
and at nine o’clock we lay to at Isaca, where we passed that night
and the following day. During the night the wind changed to the
north-east, and there was a good breeze stirring. The banks of the
river are so low that the least wind prevents the canoes making
way; for when the water is ever so little agitated the waves dash
over their sides and sink them; an accident of frequent occurrence.
The population of Isaca may amount to seven or eight hundred, all
Foulahs. Their houses, which are built of bricks baked in the sun,
resemble those of the Bambaras.</p>

<p>The inhabitants brought us fresh fish, sour milk, and butter,
which we purchased. The butter was rolled up into little balls of
the size of crab-apples, for which we paid six cowries each. In
this village I saw a great quantity of dried fish, an article in
which the inhabitants traffic very considerably. They carry it to
Jenné and other neighbouring markets. The great arm of the river
which, as the negroes informed me, branches off from Sego, and
forms an immense island, rejoins the river a quarter of a mile from
Isaca. This arm, which comes from the west, is very broad, and
seems to be navigable for large boats. It has not a rapid current;
indeed, the water appears to be almost stagnant. The village is
situated on the right bank of the river, and is inhabited by
Foulahs, similar to those of Fouta-Dhialon. They are the subjects
of Sego-Ahmadou, the capital of which al-Lamdou Lillahi, is a day’s
journey eastward from Isaca. They rear flocks, which are their
principal wealth, and cultivate rice in the plains, inundated by
the overflow of the waters. They fish with nets made of cotton
cord.</p>

<p>The women manufacture a beautiful kind of pottery, which they
sell at Jenné, and to the canoes going to Timbuctoo. The village is
situated on a little eminence; it is a great market for
provisions.</p>

<p>Before I proceed further I will give a description of the canoes
which are employed in the passage from Jenné to Timbuctoo, and
which keep up a continually active trade along the whole extent of
the river. Little flotillas of sixty or eighty boats are frequently
seen all richly laden with various kinds of produce.</p>

<p>A vessel of sixty, or eighty tons burthen, is about ninety or
one hundred feet long, twelve or fourteen broad at midships, and
draws six or seven feet depth of water. These canoes, whether large
or small, are generally fragile, and it is astonishing how they
bear the heavy cargoes with which they are laden, and which consist
of rice, millet, butter, honey, onions, pistachios, colat-nuts,
stuffs, and various kinds of preserved articles. In addition to
their cargo they frequently have on board forty or fifty slaves,
half of whom remain on deck.</p>

<p>The crew consists of sixteen or eighteen sailors, two steersmen,
and a superior, who acts as captain. The manner in which these
vessels are built shews their want of solidity. Large planks, five
feet long by eight inches broad, and about one inch thick,<a id=
"FNanchor_01"></a><a href="#Footnote_01" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
are adjusted and fixed together by ropes made from the hemp of the
country and the leaves of the ronnier. These ropes possess the
property of lasting a long time in water, an advantage of great
importance in this country, where the inhabitants do not avail
themselves of the use of iron.</p>

<p>The workmen first of all join the planks together; but they do
not unite closely, and large interstices are left in this first
joining. The seams are then caulked over with bruised straw,
reduced to a sort of oakum, and mixed with a soft kind of clay,
found in the morasses and on the banks of the river. The
interstices thus filled up, the seams are closely covered with
fresh straw, and the whole is strongly fastened by a second
joining; this renders the canoe sufficiently solid for the purpose
of navigating the river At the bottom, wooden bars are laid at
certain distances to consolidate the whole mass; and similar bars
are placed higher up, for supporting the deck. The hull being
finished, it is covered over with small pieces of flexible wood,
bent in a convex form, across which, other pieces of smaller size
are fixed. This forms the deck, which is raised three feet and a
half above the sides, and covered over with mats, made in the
country from the leaves of the ronnier. The lightest merchandise is
placed on the deck, or orlop, and is firmly lashed to the gunwales
of the vessel, forming a sort of barrier, not very high, but
sufficiently so to prevent the slaves, who sleep on deck, from
rolling into the water. The vessel is loaded to the height of two
feet and a half or three feet above the deck, even on the prow.</p>

<p>As they are unacquainted with the use of pumps, they leave in
the middle of the canoe an open space, where two men are constantly
stationed, and whose business it is to bale out the water which
makes its way through the seams of the vessel. In spite of the
quickness with which they work, the water on board is never less
than half a foot deep. These men keep watch as in our European
ships, and they are relieved every six hours. They use large
calabashes to bale the vessel. I observed that this part of the
canoe is always covered with moss of a fine green colour. This is
also the place where the women kindle fires to cook the victuals of
the crew; for which purpose they provide themselves with portable
earthenware stoves. These stoves are in the form of
chaffing-dishes, round and open, and are composed of glazed
earthenware. They are manufactured at Jenné, or in its environs,
and are nearly four feet in circumference. They are furnished with
three little supports, forming a tripod, on which the pot, used for
boiling the rice, rests. These portable stoves obviate all danger
that might be apprehended from the use of fire on board the
vessels. Before the cargo is put on board, the hold is lined with
thick pieces of wood, to prevent the goods being damaged by
damp.</p>

<p>These vessels being unprovided with sails, cannot make way
except in very calm weather; they are besides so frail, that the
slightest wind agitating the river (the banks of which are very
low) produces waves, which, by dashing against the sides of the
canoes, would either damage or swamp them. This danger often causes
delay, and renders the navigation tedious and perilous. When the
banks are entirely free from bushes, the sailors row or tow the
vessel along, and when they can reach the bottom of the river with
poles, they push it. In this manner the greater part of the passage
is effected, and it was by means of these poles, which are about
twelve or fifteen feet long, that I was enabled to judge of the
depth of the river. It is very difficult to find wood of such a
length in this country, and it is necessary to fix two pieces
together lengthwise to form the poles. It sometimes happens that
the banks are covered with bushes, and that the river is so deep
that these poles cannot reach the bottom; in such cases the sailors
move the vessel forward by paddles three feet long; and a place for
the rowers is left open, quite at the fore part of the vessel,
occupying only twelve or fourteen feet. They sometimes stand up
close against the side of the vessel, and at other times sit upon
the merchandise, having scarcely room to turn themselves round in
consequence of the crowded state of the canoe. These men are naked;
they row very fast, and keep time.</p>

<p>The master stands at the stern and steers the vessel, not
without difficulty, by a long pole instead of a rudder. He
experiences a good deal of trouble in managing the unwieldy
machine, so that it is often found necessary for two others to
assist him. A rudder like that attached to the boats which descend
the Seine, would be extremely serviceable, but at present the
people are ignorant of the use of such a thing. Each of these
vessels has a captain, who maintains great authority over his crew,
and I never witnessed any abuse of this authority, as is sometimes
the case with us, especially in the merchant service. All the negro
sailors who navigate the river are slaves; there are also some
captains of this class, whose employers give them half of what they
earn. Free men think themselves degraded by accepting such
employment.</p>

<p>On the 28th, at four o’clock in the morning, the wind fell and
we continued our course towards the north. The breadth of the river
did not vary, and its banks continued low and naked. About seven
o’clock in the morning the N. E. wind blew stronger than on the
preceding day, and we were obliged to anchor before a large plain
of white quicksand, which, when inundated by the rising of the
waters, forms a great bank; the channel is on the left side of the
river. The wind, blowing up the sand in great quantities, added to
the inconvenience we were suffering from the heat.</p>

<p>To lighten the canoe all the slaves were set on shore, and the
rice-grinders were sent to continue their work on the plain. At
sunset the wind fell a little, and the oars might have been used
during the whole of the night, but the negroes, to whom time is of
no value, and who are never in a hurry to reach their destination,
thought proper to wait till morning.</p>

<p>The slaves, male and female, all Bambaras, began to leap, dance,
and amuse themselves in various ways. Their gaiety, however, proved
the cause of some trouble to us, for the Foulahs, observing them,
came on board at night-fall in a party of about thirty, armed with
bows and pikes. They severely censured the impropriety of allowing
the slaves to dance during the Ramadan, observing that it was like
making a scoff of religion, and that, as a punishment for such
misconduct, a fine of five thousand cowries (a sum equal to
twenty-five francs) must be paid. The master, to whose charge the
slaves had been committed, earnestly defended the cause of his
employer. A spirited altercation arose between the parties, who
were seated in a circle upon the sand. The Foulahs for some time
shewed no disposition to forego their demands, but at length they
were taught reason, and the dispute ended at the expense of the
poor slaves, who, as a punishment for dancing during this sacred
season, were each condemned to receive five lashes on the back. The
sentence, however, was not executed with much severity, and it did
not restrain the slaves from resuming their dance as soon as the
fanatical Foulahs departed.</p>

<p>From motives of prudence, I had for some time kept myself apart
from this scene, but I felt curious to know, before the departure
of these rigid defenders of Islamism, what was the subject of
dispute. I therefore approached the spot where they were and sat
down on the sand beside them. They were astonished at seeing me,
for I had hitherto escaped their observation, owing to the interest
they took in discussing the subject of the five thousand cowries,
which they conceived they had a right to exact. They told the
master that I must certainly be the chief of the canoe and the
proprietor of the cargo; that I must doubtless have money; and that
I must make them a handsome present.</p>

<p>The master answered them that I was a poor Arab, whom the
christians had carried off from his country when a boy, and that I
was proceeding to Mecca, to seek my relatives. This explanation
seemed to satisfy them, for they asked no more questions about
me.</p>

<p>The proprietor of the canoe had put a Mandingo negro on board,
to take care of the cargo. This person was also directed to attend
to me; a duty which he performed very negligently, for, after
leaving Jenné, he gave me nothing but rice boiled in water, the
food of the slaves. He was more strict than the Moors, and fasted
on the voyage, not partaking of any thing until a repast was served
to us at half past six in the evening. This was the best meal I had
throughout the day, for he added a little dry fish and vegetable
butter to the dish. However, he made me eat at other times with the
slaves. I complained of this treatment, but the only reply given to
my repeated remonstrances was, that he did not choose to have the
trouble of lighting a fire for only one person, and that I must be
content with what he gave me. Not being able to do better, I
patiently bore my misfortune, and considered myself lucky when I
procured a little sour milk to relish my dinner.</p>

<p>On the 29th of March, about three o’clock in the morning, we
again put off. During the night time, the polar star served me for
a compass, and the position of the stars enabled me to guess the
hour. About nine o’clock a fresh breeze having sprung up, we were
obliged to wait till midday, when we began to move on. At two
o’clock we again stopped. The excessive heat brought upon me an
attack of fever, which, fortunately, was not followed by any bad
consequences. At five o’clock in the evening, the wind dropped, and
we were enabled to continue our voyage. At sun-set, we passed a
village on the left bank, close to which an arm of the river
branches off to the west. At eight in the evening, we found
ourselves before Wanza, having constantly advanced in a northern
direction. We lay to about one o’clock in the morning, at a point
where there was no village. Here the river might be three quarters
of a mile broad, and from eight to nine feet deep; the banks were
uniformly low and bare.</p>

<p>On the 30th of March, at six in the morning, we put off, still
in the same direction. About nine o’clock, a violent north-east
wind arose, and obliged us to halt before the village of Sansan.
Here the river is of considerable breadth, but the banks being
ornamented with mimosas, presented a pleasing prospect after the
long absence of all vegetation. About five in the evening, the wind
falling a little, we advanced to the north-east. The country on
either side of the river was covered with numerous herds of oxen,
whose lowing was heard at a great distance; they belonged to the
Foulahs, residing in a village at some distance from the shore, and
whose only property is their cattle. At six in the evening, we
passed over a sand-bank, extending across the river, which is here
a full mile in breadth. The canoe ran aground several times, and
the men were obliged to jump into the water in order to get it
afloat, for which about four feet and a half water was requisite.
By great efforts we gained the channel, which runs near the right
bank. Here I saw thousands of trumpet-birds, which came down in
flocks upon the sand banks, and by their shrill cries seemed to
sound a charge upon the fish, destined by nature for their prey.
There were also great numbers of ducks, water-fowl, puffets,
pelicans, and egrets, and multitudes of the other varieties of
water birds, which inhabit these marshes, and brood undisturbed by
the people of the surrounding countries. Powder is a very scarce
article here, and lead is unknown; pikes, therefore, form the only
arms of the inhabitants.</p>

<p>We continued our course till midnight; when, our wearied rowers
requiring rest, we moored the vessel to two stakes fixed in the
shore, and went to sleep.</p>

<p>On the thirty-first of March, at six in the morning, we started
in a northern direction. At seven we passed the village of
Corocoïla, situated on the right bank. This place contained from
five to six hundred inhabitants, chiefly Foulahs, and also some who
came originally from Jenné. In all the villages on the banks of the
river the same language is spoken as at Timbuctoo and Jenné; it is
called the <i>Kissour</i>. The Foulah language also is spoken in
those places. The banks of the river were still covered with
numerous herds of oxen.</p>

<p>At ten o’clock, we lay to about two miles to the north of Cobi.
Between this small village and Corocoïla is a pretty little island,
about two miles in circumference, covered with the finest
vegetation; I was astonished to find it uninhabited. In the evening
we made three miles towards the north, for the purpose of reaching
Cona, the first village in the country of Banan, which the negroes
call <i>Banan-dougou (land of Banan)</i>. Cona contains about eight
hundred inhabitants, all negroes. There are in the country some
Mandingoes and Foulahs, who are engaged in trade. It is situated on
the right bank of the river, and its environs are marshy.</p>

<p>The people on board our vessel purchased tamarinds, earthen
pots, and untanned ox-hides used for packing. The inhabitants
brought us milk, giraumons, and other articles.</p>

<p>In this place I met two Moors from Adrar, owners of a very large
canoe of eighty tons burden at least. They were going to Timbuctoo
to dispose of the merchandise they had bought at Jenné. A small
vessel of seven or eight tons, was employed to carry themselves and
provisions for their use and it followed the large canoe at various
distances; for the latter, encumbered with merchandise, advanced
but slowly.</p>

<p>After introducing themselves, they invited me to partake of
their boiled rice and some milk, while supper was preparing. About
seven in the evening they proceeded on their passage, but we stayed
until the next day. Several of our men went to the village to make
small purchases for a venture. Banan is independent of
Ségo-Ahmadou: it is situated upon the right bank of the river, and
extends very far to the east. The inhabitants are all Mahometans,
and the slaves, who are very numerous, are employed in tilling the
ground. The people build canoes, and make voyages to Jenné and
Timbuctoo. They are very rich in herds of oxen, sheep and goats,
and rear great quantities of poultry. They are very industrious,
and manufacture cotton stuffs, which they sell to the people of the
neighbouring towns and villages. The cotton tree, which they
cultivate, flourishes exceedingly in this place. They also make
cloth from the wool of sheep, for the purpose of traffic.</p>

<p>I saw the inhabitants, who never go out unless armed with pikes,
and bows and arrows. They have woolly hair and a very black
complexion, and are in other respects like the Mandingoes, to which
race indeed they belong, though they speak another language.</p>

<p>About ten at night, we left the village of Cona, with a fine
moon-light that would have favoured our progress, but the negroes
thought proper to lie to at eleven o’clock. As soon as the vessels
are anchored they betake themselves to sleep, without leaving any
one to keep watch, for they are not accustomed to such duty when at
anchor.</p>

<p>On the 1st of April, at six in the morning, we made ready to
start: a breeze was blowing, which however, about midnight so
encreased in violence, that we were compelled to stop. Had we
attempted to proceed, the canoe would infallibly have been
destroyed; for during this gale it made more water than usual.</p>

<p>The frequent halts which we were obliged to make were very
annoying to me; for I was obliged to remain on board exposed to the
heat of the sun. How pleased should I have been had the adjacent
country been like the smiling shores of the Senegal! But here the
immense monotonous plains on all sides fatigue the eye of the
traveller.</p>

<p>The course of the river, though winding in some parts, is still
northward. On the morning of the 1st of April, I observed a large
hill, about two hundred and fifty feet high, distant three or four
miles from the left bank of the river. It was without vegetation,
and appeared to be composed of red sand.</p>

<p>We daily expected the owner of the canoe, who, on departing from
Jenné, promised to join us in two days. He had assured me, that
even in his absence I should be well treated on board. The case,
however, was quite the reverse, so I looked for him with the utmost
impatience, trusting that his presence would better my
condition.</p>

<p>After my departure from Jenné, I had the misery of being the
only white man among the negroes, and with their language I was
unacquainted. This circumstance, joined to my being a stranger, and
almost destitute, emboldened them to insult me in the grossest
manner. I was absolutely ranked and treated as a slave.</p>

<p>During the day the heat was excessive, and I had great trouble
to find a place where I could be shaded from the burning sun, which
was almost insupportable, even in a state of inaction. In the night
I slept on deck, for there was no room for me below. I was exposed
to the dew and all the inclemency of the night; but I took the
precaution of wrapping myself in a sheep-skin. However, this did
not prevent me from being seized, on the 31st March, with a violent
fit of illness. I experienced severe numbness, followed by great
weakness, and my stomach rejected food.</p>

<p>During my illness I was permitted to go into the cabin; but the
place assigned me there was very inconvenient. I was with a
Mandingo and his female slave; and they allowed me so little room
that I could not lie straight; my head touched my knees. I had been
particularly recommended to the care of this negro by the sherif
Oulad-Marmou; but he paid no regard to the directions he had
received, and showed as little pity for me as the rest of the crew.
I ought, however, to exempt from this censure a young Foulah from
Massina, to whom the sherif had also recommended me. He was the
only one who had behaved to me with any kindness. He went on shore
whenever I asked him, bought me milk, and rendered me all the
service he could. He even endeavoured to console me when I
expressed dissatisfaction at the inattention with which I was
treated by the rest. He often reprimanded the slaves, who,
following the example of their superiors, behaved with the grossest
insolence towards me. In short, I should have been much worse off
had it not been for the attention of this kind-hearted young
man.</p>

<p>In the course of my travels I have often had intercourse with
the Mandingoes, and, with the single exception of those of Cambaya,
in the Fouta, I have always found them arrogant when possessed of
any little authority, while they are fawning, mean, and servile, to
their superiors. I have seen them, in the passage from Tinné to
Jenné, insult the poor Bambaras while selling their merchandise,
speaking harshly to them, and even abusing them in their own
language; but whenever the Bambaras showed a disposition to resent
this treatment, the Mandingoes became all at once silent and
humble. The women have the same faults, in addition to which they
have insufferably harsh voices.</p>

<p>On the 1st of April, the wind continued blowing till four in the
evening, when it fell a little. We rowed in a northern direction.
Near half past six in the evening we halted at Toï. The river still
continued the same; the banks being low and bare, and in many
places not a single shrub can be seen. At nine o’clock, we started,
and all night advanced towards the north. The river makes a few
small windings to the east.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of April the weather continued calm. Towards eight
o’clock in the morning we passed some large islands, situated not
far from the mouth of the lake Débo. The river is here divided by
several islands, which separate it into different narrow branches
of great depth. Two of these islands are larger than the rest, and
might be habitable, for, when the river overflows, they are only
partially inundated. On one of these islands, there are the huts of
fishermen, and of shepherds, whose numerous flocks find rich
pasture on the marshes. These marshes are covered by aquatic birds
of every kind. There is an infinite number of other small islands
covered with rank grass, and inundated at all seasons. When this
immense river overflows all the herbage is under water, and then
the lake appears much more extensive; its banks are no longer
perceptible, and it might be mistaken for an inland Sea.</p>

<p>After a slow navigation, during which we made repeated halts, we
reached the mouth of the great lake about three in the afternoon.
About six miles S. W. of this entrance, there is a rock in the form
of a truncated sugarloaf; it is situated in an inundated marsh
which is covered with green herbage. This enormous rock, which is
quite bare, forms a singular contrast with the freshness of the
surrounding vegetation. As it has, though a very striking
land-mark, received no name from the natives, I thought proper to
give it one, and have named the whole spot St. Charles’s Island. In
the lake, and about nine or ten miles to the N. E. is a small
island on which I observed some trees almost destitute of leaves.
It is capable of being inhabited, and affords facilities for the
formation of a good port. I have named it Henry Island, in honour
of his Royal Highness the Duke of Bourdeaux. A third island, also
formed of rock, is situated between these two, a little to the
eastward of the line which would intersect them, and to it I have
given the name of Maria-Theresa, in honour of her Royal Highness
the Dauphiness. Two of these islands appear to command the mouth of
the lake. Were a fort built on one of the three it would command
the environs, and the navigation would be under the control of the
possessor.</p>

<p>To the N. N. E. of the island of Maria-Theresa we observed a
hill about fifty or sixty fathoms high. It is composed of red
earth, and of large porous rocks of the same colour. Some fishermen
have established themselves on the declivity of this hill, which is
extremely arid.</p>

<p>Land is seen on every side of the lake except on the west, where
it spreads out like an inland sea. On coasting along its northern
side, and steering nearly W. N. W. to the distance of fifteen
miles, we leave on the left a tongue of very flat land, which
extends several miles southward. It seems to close the passage of
the lake, and to form a kind of strait. Beyond this barrier the
lake is prolonged, as I have said, towards the west, until it is
lost in the horizon.</p>

<p>The barrier I have just mentioned divides lake Debo into two
lakes, the upper and the lower. That through which the boats
passed, and in which the three islands I have mentioned are
situated, is very large. It extends in an easterly direction, and
is surrounded by extensive marshes. Land is visible on every
side.</p>

<p>When we had advanced as far as the middle of the first division,
three of the large boats fired some muskets, to salute this
majestic lake, and the crew of each boat shouted with all their
might <i>Salam! Salam!</i> repeating the cry several times. We
stood off from the eastern bank and navigated with great caution:
the lake was calm and the water clear. The current was not
perceptible on its surface, the depth of the part which we
navigated was twelve or thirteen feet. The canoes were merely
rowed, and advanced very slowly. I could not recover from my
surprise at seeing so great a mass of water in the heart of the
country. There was something very majestic in the sight.</p>

<p>About five in the evening we arrived off Gabibi, a small fishing
village on the right bank of the lake. The huts of this village are
made of straw and of a round form. Since we entered the lake we had
stood to the N. E. We passed close to the island of Maria-Theresa,
on which I observed some fine granite of a bright chesnut colour.
We took our departure from Gabibi, and at sun-set I saw, for the
first time, since I left the coast, that luminary sink into a sort
of ocean.</p>

<p>We proceeded along the shore, at some distance from it, in the
direction of W. N. W. The boatmen sang while they pushed along the
canoe with their poles. We observed large blocks of granite on the
shore. We brought to about eleven at night off Didhiover, a large
village inhabited by Foulahs, who have only straw huts like those
of the pastoral Foulahs. Some negroes went to the village to buy
giraumons. We could not procure a single drop of milk.</p>

Description of the place.</p>

<p>On the 3rd of April we took our departure from the village of
Didhiover, which is situated near the northern entrance of the
lake. The river on issuing from the lake may be about six miles
broad. At sun-rise we stood towards the north. In the course of the
morning we passed the village of Tongom, which belongs to the
country of the Dirimans. It contains about four or five hundred
inhabitants.</p>

<p>About one in the afternoon, we lay to at a spot where we
observed bushes and cut some for fire-wood. At this spot the river
is only about three quarters of a mile broad. I went ashore with
the slaves. The land, which is subject to inundations, is not
destitute of vegetation. I saw naucleas and mimosas twelve feet
high. In the course of the voyage, the master of the canoe asked me
to lend him five thousand cowries, until the Moor, who was the
owner, and who was daily expected, should arrive. The negro had
already cheated me more than once, and as I was apprehensive that I
should never be repaid, which would have infallibly been the case,
I refused to lend him such a sum. He made several individuals apply
to me for him, but I would not comply. Finding that I was
determined not to lend him the cowries, he threw out threats
against me, and went so far as to pull me by the legs to make me
leave the boat. He collected what articles belonged to me and threw
them on deck, accompanying the action with many violent and rude
expressions. He intimated that he would drive me among the slaves,
and thus insulted me in a thousand different ways.</p>

<p>When I went on shore he objected to my going in the small boat.
I knew not to whom I could complain of all these vexations, for
there was no person on board who could protect me. At last the
young Foulah obtained his consent to my going in the little canoe,
to be put on shore along with some slaves. On landing, I seated
myself under the shade of a mimosa, and, reflecting sorrowfully on
the disagreeable situation in which I should be placed during the
voyage if I did not lend him the cowries, I resolved to make that
sacrifice. He came on shore to me, and assailed me with fresh
reproaches, insisting at the same time that I certainly ought to
place confidence in him, and assuring me that he would repay the
debt on the arrival of his master. Though my resources were greatly
diminished, and I felt that the strictest economy was
indispensible, I promised for the sake of peace to lend him a
thousand cowries. From that moment our quarrel terminated. His
example was however followed by one of his comrades. These two
negroes completely abused the advantage which circumstances had
given them over me; and when we arrived at Timbuctoo I found it
impossible to procure repayment.</p>

<p>About three o’clock in the afternoon, while we were proceeding
on our voyage, the canoe, which had put off from the shore with the
slaves to bring them on board, sunk in consequence of being leaky
and overloaded. The poor women, embarrassed by the weight of the
pagnes about their loins, were in the greatest danger: but prompt
assistance was given and every one was got on board without any
further accident. It is usual to anchor the boats close to the
banks of the river, but when the canoe filled we were under
way.</p>

<p>The river here makes an elbow towards the east of about six
miles; it then stretches towards the north. It is every where broad
and deep, but the banks are low and bare.</p>

<p>About seven in the evening we anchored opposite Mujo, a village
of the Diriman country, containing from three hundred and fifty to
four hundred inhabitants. The huts are of straw and in the
sugar-loaf form. In the evening I was informed of the arrival of
Sidi-Mbark,<a id="FNanchor_02"></a><a href="#Footnote_02" class=
"fnanchor">[2]</a> the owner of our vessel. I immediately went to
him and complained of the bad conduct of his people to me, but he
paid little attention to my representations: he was along with a
Moorish friend on board a small boat of six tons burthen. He had
determined to get under way, immediately in order to reach
Timbuctoo before us. I expressed a wish to go with him in his boat
which moved rapidly, but he alleged that it was already too heavily
laden, and that besides it was so small that there was not sleeping
room for me. He once more consigned me to the care of the Mandingo,
ordering him to supply me with provisions during the remainder of
the voyage, and to treat me better than he had hitherto done.
Sidi-Mbark afterwards tried to console me, advising me to have
patience, and assuring me that we were not far from Cabra, which
was the place of our destination.</p>

<p>The Moors of Adrar, whom I had seen in the country of Banan,
stopped with us at the same spot. They sent Sidi-Mbark a plentiful
supper, consisting of rice, and dried meat, seasoned with giraumons
and the small onions of the country. He invited me to partake of
the meal; and I accepted his invitation with pleasure, for it was
late and I had not yet supped. The Moors shew great address in
eating with the fingers; for my part, however, though I had long
been accustomed to take my food by handfuls, I was still far from
being as expert as they: I sometimes let part of the mess fall on
the ground which gave them great offence, and made them vent their
anger in maledictions on the Christians, who, they observed, had
not even taught me how to eat decently. This was the first
comfortable meal I had made since my departure from Jenné.
Sidi-Mbark gave his men colat-nuts to purchase provisions. I
returned on board our boat, where I soon learned how little regard
was paid to the directions of the master when he was absent.</p>

<p>At sun-rise we stood towards the north, at the rate of two miles
an hour, leaving Mbark asleep in his boat; he soon got up with us
however, for he had six good rowers: he came alongside of our boat
and put on board some merchandise, which had embarrassed him on
account of the room it occupied. He then gave his final orders and
left us, expressing his hope that every man would do his duty. The
river takes a turn to the west, the banks continue low, but at this
spot, the right bank was not entirely destitute of wood. At ten
o’clock we came to a spot were it made an elbow towards the N. E.
About half past ten we passed Co, a large village, in the environs
of which we observed some tamarind-trees and ronniers: the left
bank is formed by sand hills. There is a little island in the midst
of the river opposite to Co; it is inhabited by five or six hundred
Foulahs who have numerous flocks. At noon we found the course of
the river turning towards the N. E. and we proceeded with it in
that direction until half-past four, when it elbowed round to the
north. At this hour we passed in front of Do. The river then
stretched westward. It is still broad and deep enough for the
boatmen to use their paddles in navigating. At half-past six we
halted at Sa, a large village surrounded with a wall and shaded by
some tamarind-trees, (<i>tamarindus indicus</i>). This was the only
village with a wall which I had seen on the banks of the river
since we left Isaca. Here we joined from thirty to forty large
boats, all bound for Timbuctoo. Many of these vessels were of about
eighty tons burthen. Sa is a rendezvous for the vessels which
navigate in this direction. It is their practice to assemble at
this port and to proceed on the voyage together, to guard against
the depredations of a tribe in the neighbourhood of this town, who
often board their boats and commit acts of violence and robbery.
They are called by the natives Soorgoos, and by the Moors Tooariks.
There were in the port of Sa from four to five hundred persons,
seamen and inhabitants, who gazed at the flotilla. The port was
covered with bales of merchandise, ready to be shipped on board the
canoes. The commercial activity appeared astonishing. There was
something in the appearance of the flotilla far more interesting
than I could have expected to find in the interior of Africa. The
bustle on every side almost made me fancy myself in a trading port
of Europe. The largest vessels belong to Moors, who carry on the
principal trade of the country: they form themselves into
companies, and employ their canoes in conveying merchandise to
Timbuctoo, where they are paid their freight in salt or
cowries.</p>

<p>On the 5th of April, at sun-rise, we got under way and steered a
northerly course until eleven o’clock, when we came to a bend in
the river, which then flowed towards the N. E. On every side we
heard the joyous cries of the sailors, who also fired muskets,
still more strongly to express their gladness. We passed the
village of Baraconga, which is situated on the left bank. About one
o’clock we anchored before Tantala, a pretty village, where we
bought some dry fish, milk, and fine mats made of ronnier leaves.
They are of a long shape and yellow colour; they are used for
sleeping on, and for making sacks.</p>

<p>We continued our course to the N. E. until sun-set, when we
passed a large branch of the river, which runs westerly. About
seven o’clock we brought to at Cooma, where we passed the night.
The river and its banks still presented the same uniformity of
aspect.</p>

<p>On the 6th of April, at five in the morning, we got under way,
and stood towards the east. The course of the river was in that
direction, but with a number of small sinuosities on the northern
and southern sides. About three in the afternoon we passed Lelel, a
large village, containing from five to six hundred inhabitants, and
situated on the left bank. A little before it reaches this village
the river elbows round to the north for a mile and a half, and then
turns back to the east. At half past four in the evening we passed
Garfola, a village without a wall, and very much resembling the
former. I observed around it multitudes of Barbary ducks and other
aquatic birds. The banks in the neighbourhood of this village are
somewhat elevated. Some baobabs, bombaces, tamarinds, somps,
mimosas, and naucleas, adorn the environs. The river may be here
about half a mile broad. About seven o’clock we anchored at Doboo,
where we passed the night.</p>

<p>On the 7th of April we waited to give time to the heavy boats,
which we had left astern, to come up, and, about eight in the
morning, stood towards the N. E. with a gentle breeze, favourable
for that course. However, as it soon began to blow fresh, we
anchored, about nine o’clock, at Filinsa, a village containing five
hundred inhabitants. A great number of canoes were under repair in
the port. I saw the carpenters at work: the only tool they used was
a small hatchet, in the form of an adze, with which they shaped
out, awkwardly enough, little pieces of plank, the greater part of
which appeared to be in a state of decay. They were indeed
fragments of old canoes which were thus used for repairs. When
there was a hole in the side of a canoe, these carpenters clapped a
bit of plank upon it, and fastened it, or, as it were, stitched it
on with rope, made of the bark of trees. These patches are always
very ill fitted, but the apertures which are left are stopped up
with a mixture of bruised straw and clay. This compound is covered
with a layer of fresh straw, which is fixed by a second stitching
with bark-rope. I am astonished that boats thus constructed do not
sink as soon as they are afloat. A man is kept constantly employed
in baling them, to prevent their filling with the water which
penetrates through the seams. These canoes belonged to fishermen.
Young girls, half naked, came on board to us with milk and fresh
butter.</p>

<p>The N. E. wind continued to blow till three o’clock, and it was
five in the morning before we began to prepare for prosecuting our
voyage. We had scarcely gone a mile when we observed that two large
boats had fallen astern, and we thought it right to wait for them.
We were then off Baracondié, a village opposite to which there is a
large island, which is inundated when the water is high. All the
villages from lake Debo belong to the Diriman country, which
extends to a great distance easterly. A number of pastoral Foulahs
also inhabit the banks of the river, and remove with their flocks
when the inundations commence.</p>

<p>On the 8th of April, at five in the morning, we left Baracondié
and directed our course westerly. About eleven we brought to off
the village of Tircy. The N. E. wind, Which blew a gale, obliged us
to anchor. Here the river takes a turn towards the north. The
village of Tircy contains about six hundred inhabitants; it
consists of straw huts, of the same form as those of the pastoral
Foulahs who inhabit the banks of the Senegal.</p>

<p>In the surrounding marshes I observed a number of negroes
gathering a large herb, which grows only in marshy grounds. This
plant is called kondoo: they dry it in the sun, and then pass it
rapidly over a flame to burn off the leaves, as the stalks only are
preserved. Of these they make large bundles, which they carry home
on their heads. I also saw several asses loaded with these bundles.
I asked my comrades what was done with this plant: they told me,
that after it is well washed and dried by the women, it is reduced
to a fine powder, which is put into a large earthen vase, having
the bottom perforated with small holes. Upon the powder warm water
is poured, and, in filtering, the water becomes impregnated with
the essence of the plant, which is of a saccharine nature. The
liquor thus obtained is much esteemed by the natives, who relish it
greatly; but it has the effect of a purgative on persons not
accustomed to drink it. It always retains a slightly smoky flavour,
which renders it disagreeable to strangers. The Mahomedan natives
indulge in this beverage without scruple: the Moors also drink it,
but they always mix with it a little sour milk.</p>

<p>The stalk of the kondoo is as thick as a reed; it is a creeping
plant, about eight or ten feet long; the leaves, which are narrow,
are six or eight inches long; their edges are indented or serrated.
The banks of the Dhioliba are covered with this plant. The Dirimans
and some Foulahs who inhabit Tircy came to sell us this liquor,
sour milk, fresh butter, dry fish, and mats. About a glassful of
milk was sold for five cowries. I suppose that provisions were
scarce in this village, for the dealers hawked their goods on the
shore, and, in general, would take nothing but millet in payment.
It is true, that among the number, there were many pastoral Foulahs
who pay no attention to agriculture, and whose only resource
consists in their cattle. Never travelling, and not being near any
markets, cowries are of no use to them; but millet is always a
ready and acceptable food. A bowl full of millet purchases twice
the quantity of milk which the same bowl will hold. This is the
fixed rate of dealing in the country. Young girls of twelve or
fourteen years lined the bank of the river, offering to sell us
their merchandise: they were nearly naked, having only a pagne
round their loins.</p>

<p>Soon after our arrival at the village of Tircy, we learned that
some of the large boats had run aground, and that one of them had
been completely swamped. This unforeseen accident occasioned
considerable delay in the progress of the flotilla, which was
obliged to stop in order to give assistance to the wrecked boat.
The crews of the canoes hastened to help them; the greater part of
the merchandise was floating about in the river, and,
notwithstanding the activity which every individual displayed, only
a very small part of the cargo was saved. This was a considerable
loss to the owners; for, though the trade is very brisk, the
merchants know nothing of the means of protecting themselves from
risks by insurances. Notwithstanding this unfortunate occurrence,
the Moor, whose neglect had caused it, did not appear in the least
concerned.</p>

<p>The 9th and 10th of April were employed in dragging some bags of
rice and millet out of the water; the negroes plunged in and one
was drowned. All the negroes of the flotilla came to the aid of the
wrecked canoe; they generally have an interest in rendering this
kind of service, for they receive, by way of reward, a portion of
the merchandise they save, except the manufactured stuffs, the
value of which they are paid in millet and rice.</p>

<p>I saw at Tircy the two Moors of Adrar whom I had met at Banan;
they greeted me cordially, and invited me many times to sup with
them. As I knew these people think much of presents, I gave them a
part of my dokhnou, a little baked bread, and a sheet of paper;
these things they received with gratitude. One of them asked me
whether I wanted some cowries to purchase milk with: as I had still
from five to six thousand left, I thanked them, but declined their
obliging offer.</p>

<p>The women of the Dirimans, like all who live on the banks of the
river from Jenné to Timbuctoo, have their hair ornamented with
small glass beads; they also wear glass, and sometimes metal rings
in their noses. My fellow travellers told me that these people are
robbers, and that they often practise great cruelties; this I was
ready enough to believe, for, during the two days I staid among
them, I observed much quarrelling and fighting. Their dress is the
same as that of the people of Jenné; like them, they have woolly
black hair. They have handsome countenances, aquiline noses, thin
lips, and large eyes; they are armed with two or three pikes and a
dagger, which they promptly make use of on the least provocation.
After being engaged in a quarrel, they fall devoutly to their
prayers, for they are Musulmans, and they often rise from their
religious duties merely to begin fresh contentions. They use the
bow and arrow against their enemies; but some were armed with
muskets, and some with sabres; these weapons had been introduced by
Europeans. I saw a man walking on the bank of the river with a
calabash full of saltpetre, which he offered for sale: I was
desirous of knowing in what way it had been procured; the Moors
informed me that saltpetre was manufactured in the country, and
that it was used for making gunpowder.</p>

<p>The village of Alcodia, the residence of the chief of the
Dirimans, is situated to the east of Tircy, from which it is a day
and a half’s journey distant. The crew, having saved all the
merchandise they could, prepared to start the next day.</p>

<p>On the 11th of April, at six in the morning, we left the village
of Tircy; the course of the river is northward. At seven o’clock we
passed Talbocoila; about nine we halted to take in our stock of
fire-wood. The wind blew gently from N. E. Two hours after we had
re-embarked, we observed that the river, which had hitherto always
continued of an equal width, became very narrow and deep; its banks
were still low and bare. In many places we saw on the right bank
quicksands, of a bright yellow colour; I perceived numerous herds
of cattle grazing in the surrounding marshes.</p>

<p>From five o’clock in the evening till seven, when we halted, the
river continued its course to the north. We saw a good many
hippopotami, who kept at some distance; I could see nothing of them
but their heads: the negroes assured me that they often saw them,
and that if they passed near the canoes they would shatter them, as
it were, with a touch. The river at this part is a little wider, we
crossed it to the other side during the night.</p>

<p>I gave the captain of the canoe (who since I had lent him some
cowries had become more civil) a bit of coloured cloth, to make him
a cap, on condition that he would supply me with proper food, till
our arrival at Cabra; thus I was much better fed, than I had
previously been, for the captain, who was not very scrupulous, took
no notice of the Rhamadan, and, indeed, lived very well for that
country.</p>

<p>In the course of the night we were awakened by the roaring of
wild beasts.</p>

<p>On the 12th of April, at five in the morning, we stood to the
east; the river continued narrow, but deep; its width, however, was
still nearly equal to that of the Senegal at Podor; about eight
o’clock it made an elbow to the south, and became narrower. This
part of the river may be called the <i>dungeon</i>, the name given
to a particular part of the Senegal which is extremely narrow. The
country on all sides is low and damp, and very bare; at the narrow
part of the river, I have just mentioned, there are several marshy
islands, some of which are flooded all the year round; we also
observed four great arms, two on each side. The river seemed to
lose itself in the marshes, the banks being so low that, even at
this season, they are well nigh overflowed.</p>

<p>These marshes, extending as far as the eye can reach, are
covered with pasturage, and frequented by multitudes of water-fowl
of every species; by numerous herds of cattle, sheep, and some
horses, breaking, by their various cries, the silence of these
desert regions. These herds belong to the pastoral Foulahs, who
came to the river’s side to sell us their milk; they wanted to
barter it for tobacco, of which we had none to give them; we were,
consequently, obliged to go without their milk, for they would not
accept cowries in exchange.</p>

<p>When, by the overflowing of the river, all the marshes are
covered to the depth of eight or ten feet, this immense plain forms
a vast lake; at those periods, the tribes of pastoral Foulahs, who
have their huts in the neighbourhood, are obliged to retire into
the interior, where the pasture is abundant during the rainy
season. Continuing our course till ten o’clock in the morning, we
found the river bend to the north; at this part, a very wide arm,
branching from the river, extended to the east.</p>

<p>About eleven we passed Salacoila, a village of the wandering
Foulahs, situated on the right bank; they build their huts on the
quicksands. I went ashore with a negro to purchase a little milk,
and saw some of the women, who were pretty well dressed; they would
not take our cowries, but wanted millet or rice in exchange. They
seemed very gentle in their manners; I visited their little
habitations; they are of a circular form, made of a very pretty
kind of matting, manufactured in the place; this is laid on poles
which are fixed in the ground, and which, being flexible, curve
inward at top; seven or eight of these huts were surrounded by
quickset hedges of <i>celane</i>, a euphorbious plant which grows
spontaneously on the sandy shores of the Senegal; these huts were
very neat, being cleanly swept in the inside: they had no other
furniture than a few mats spread on the ground, by way of bedding:
some calabashes, wooden plates and skins for holding milk, were the
only domestic utensils I saw. These Foulahs have the same cast of
features and the same resemblance one to another as those in the
neighbourhood of the Senegal; they, however, speak another
language, though they perfectly understand that which is spoken at
Timbuctoo. The only dress of the women was an apron tied round
their waists. They were all exceedingly clean, and I do not think
their hair was greased. They came in crowds to see me, being very
curious, and apparently, very devout, for when I was going away
they took up some sand in their hands and earnestly requested me to
pray over it.<a id="FNanchor_03"></a><a href="#Footnote_03" class=
"fnanchor">[3]</a> I complied with their wishes, gravely muttering
some verses of the Koran. They then carefully rolled up the sand in
their aprons, with the intention of preserving it as a precious
talisman. The nenuphar (<i>nymphæa cærulea</i>) grows in abundance
in the immense marshes which surround Salacoila. The largest
species of this plant bears a beautiful blue flower. The
inhabitants gather and dry the seed, and it affords them a valuable
article of food. They also procure grain from the canoes which come
from Jenné.</p>

<p>I observed the river sensibly widening. Its direction still
continued northward. About two o’clock we stopped for some canoes
that were astern of us. At four we again pushed off, steering to
the N. E. The river now widened considerably. About ten we halted
for the night. Here we again observed many hippopotami sporting
about in the water. The negroes hunt this animal and sell its
flesh, which they esteem very highly.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 13th of April, we continued our course to
the north. I occasionally observed some alligators proudly rearing
their heads to the surface of the water, and apparently threatening
any one who might be bold enough to attack them. Scarcely had we
proceeded three or four miles when we were obliged to halt to
assist a canoe which had sunk. The crews of all the vessels were
dispatched for this purpose, and the whole cargo was saved, but not
without considerable difficulty. Every one assiduously exerted
himself to dry the wet merchandise, and stow it again. During this
disorder the whole cargo was lying on the shore exposed to the
depredations of the sailors, who would have made no scruple of
appropriating any article to themselves, had not guards been
stationed here and there to watch them. When the cargo was once
more in safety, the men who had rescued it were paid with millet.
We then prepared to advance, leaving the owners and crew of the
wreck to wait till they could get another canoe from Timbuctoo.
Fortunately for them there was no village near, or part of their
cargo would in all probability have been carried off.</p>

<p>About noon we took an easterly direction; the river continued
wide, its banks low and adorned with a few bushes. Along the shore
I observed the traces of elephants, who inhabited the neighbouring
woods. I was anxious to see one of these animals, but could not
gratify my curiosity. It is strange that, during my long wanderings
in the interior of Africa, which, according to the accounts of many
travellers, is infested with wild beasts, I never met with one. At
sun-set the river took a turn to the north. About nine in the
evening we stopped to rest for the night; the heat had been
excessive.</p>

<p>At five on the morning of the 14th of April we again started.
Half an hour after sun-rise we passed two little islands pretty
close to each other; here I observed a large arm of the river
running W. S. W. At a little distance northward were two hills,
which did not appear very high.</p>

<p>At seven in the morning we found the river turning N. E. and
about nine o’clock it began to flow due east, in which direction it
continued for four or five miles; then again it turned N. E., and
about two in the afternoon we found ourselves before the little
village of Diré, a dependency of Timbuctoo. As far as I could
judge, I should suppose it contained about 150 or 200 inhabitants.
Their houses are built of earth, and have terraced roofs. In an arm
of the river which branched off in the neighbourhood of the
village, there were six vessels of sixty tons burthen, on their way
from Jenné. They had been waiting for us sixteen days. The Soorgoos
or Tooariks would not allow them to pass without the payment of a
ransom. These robbers daily went on board the canoes to levy
contributions of food. The Soorgoos are a wandering tribe who
inhabit the banks of the Dhioliba. They contrive to make themselves
feared, and live at the expense of the poor negroes, whom they make
their tributaries. I shall describe them more fully hereafter. The
vessels which had been so long detained, joined us, firing muskets
in token of their joy. The negroes of Diré, who are tributaries of
the Soorgoos, informed us that the latter were absent, and that
consequently we should escape the annoyance of their visits. In
company with the canoes which had joined us, we now proceeded about
four miles to the north-east, and afterwards turned due east. At
sun-set we were overtaken by a violent storm, and we gained the
right bank of the river, to which we moored our canoes with pikes
made for that purpose. From N. E. to S. W. the sky was overspread
with clouds driven by a gale, which continued part of the night. It
did not raise the sand, but the heat was very great.</p>

<p>At six o’clock on the morning of the 15th of April, we took an
easterly direction, and shortly afterwards I observed the river
turning S. E. It was still as wide and deep as before, and its
banks were very low. A few dwarf trees were growing in the plains.
I was astonished to see so vast a mass of water, notwithstanding
the idea I had formed of the magnitude of this river before my
departure. The Senegal is but an ordinary river in comparison with
this, which, at the season here referred to, was nine or ten feet
deep. The current is scarcely perceptible; I should think about a
knot and a half an hour. About eight in the morning we passed an
island, on which grow some low shrubs. We proceeded but slowly,
having to wait for the large canoes, which could not advance so
rapidly as we did.</p>

<p>About half past eight in the morning we lay to for half an hour
before the island. We saw the little village of Khokhoola, which
like Diré, is a dependence of Timbuctoo. Here we met a little canoe
which had left that city on the preceding morning. She had on board
several of the Soorgoos, who exact a maintenance for themselves as
far as Salacoila, where they stop, and then get conveyed home by
some returning canoes. If they cannot obtain a conveyance in this
way, they travel home by land. At Khokhoola the river takes a
little turn to the N. E. and then to the north. The Soorgoos were
waiting for us in the village, having been informed of our expected
arrival.</p>

<p>They came on board the canoes, being rowed, from the shore, in
little boats of their own. They were supplied with rice and water
and honey mixed, a beverage of which they are exceedingly fond, and
which they call <i>Jenné-hari</i> (water of Jenné.) These vagabonds
levy their exactions without moderation. We did not allow them to
come on board our canoe; we handed them out a bag of rice and they
went away to importune some of our companions. When they are on
board the canoes, and the negroes want to get rid of them, they
fire a musket close to their ears, and they speedily take their
departure, for they are very much afraid of gunpowder. They
themselves never make use of fire-arms.</p>

<p>During the visit of the Soorgoos I was directed to go below, to
avoid being seen by them; for, when they see a Moor on board,
especially if his colour be lighter than usual, they assert that he
is richer than the rest, as if his fortune depended on his
complexion. They then become extremely troublesome, and will not
suffer the canoes to depart without exacting a contribution from
the white man, whom they call <i>almankoye</i> (the rich man.).</p>

<p>I was afterwards informed that these savages had detained on
shore a Moor, whose complexion was, unluckily, not very dark, and
who was imprudent enough not to conceal himself. They extorted
merciless contributions from him. The Moors, aware of this danger,
are accustomed to conceal themselves in the canoes, and only quit
their hiding-place during the night.</p>

<p>The negroes only have the privilege of remaining on deck; they
are looked upon as an inferior class, who have not much to give,
and are merely the servants of the Moorish merchant.</p>

<p>Wishing to see without being seen, I made several holes in the
matting that covered that part of the canoe in which I was
concealed. In this place the heat was so excessive, that it gave me
a violent head-ache. The Moorish merchants of Timbuctoo have no
authority over these robbers: not one of them would have ventured
among the Soorgoos to claim the six canoes which were so long
detained. If they had, they would have been sure of being laid
under contribution themselves; yet, they frequently make presents
to the Soorgoos.</p>

<p>Each flotilla that navigates the river has a chief called the
<i>amiroo</i>, and it is he who determines the periods for halting
and starting; he is always the oldest man among the crews; it is
his business to settle the amount of the contributions with the
Soorgoos: though he has some influence over them, yet he can do
nothing in behalf of the Moors, and if the Soorgoos see one on
board his canoe, they become refractory, and often proceed to the
utmost extremities to obtain what they want. “If you were not worth
a single cowrie,” said the negroes of our canoe to me, “they would
declare that you were very rich, and you would be obliged to give
them something before they would allow us to proceed.”</p>

<p>The river, after flowing three or four miles to the north, turns
to the east, and then to the N. E.; its width still continuing the
same, and its banks being uniformly low and barren.</p>

<p>At eight in the evening we stopped before the little village of
Cora, which, perhaps, contains two hundred inhabitants. Here we had
another visit from the Soorgoos. They immediately went on board the
canoe of the chief of the flotilla, to demand the contributions.
Each canoe was ordered to put ashore a bag of millet for their
supper, and the order was obeyed without hesitation. I was informed
that the chief had engaged to pay at Cabra the exactions for
allowing us to pass; which exactions consisted of millet, rice,
honey, butter, manufactured stuffs, and preserved articles.</p>

<p>During the whole of the evening lightning flashed from the east.
The heat was oppressive, and we had no rain.</p>

<p>On the 16th of April, we were detained at Cora until ten in the
morning; the negro inhabitants of this village came to sell us
milk, for which we gave them millet in exchange; they often want
provisions, though they cultivate a great deal of rice; but they
are continually robbed and harassed by the Soorgoos, who make these
poor creatures supply them with food. At ten in the morning we
stood to the N. E. There were some Soorgoos on board the canoes,
and others were following us on horseback along the seashore. About
one in the afternoon we lay to near some trees and shrubs, and
collected a little fire-wood. At two we continued our course. At
the point we reached at sun-set the river turned to the north, and
was very wide and deep. The sailors now used their oars instead of
their poles. At eight in the evening we halted before a camp of the
Soorgoo. The discussions which arose with these people occasioned
considerable delay, and were a source of great annoyance,
especially to me, who was shut up in my hiding-place, suffocated
with heat, and only able to observe what was going on through the
holes which I had made in the mats of my prison. We were
continually harassed by troops of these banditti: some were in
small canoes, others mounted on fine horses, gallopping along the
shore, and by the most horrid yells instigating their companions in
the canoes to board us. This tumult was insufferable. We did not
entirely get rid of our tormentors until our arrival at Cabra.
Every evening our canoes were obliged to give them rice and millet
for their supper, in return for which they presented the chief of
the flotilla with a little bull, which was killed and distributed
among the masters of the different canoes. The reports of the
muskets which the negroes fired before the camp, frightened the
horses of those Soorgoos who had ridden from the interior for the
purpose of sharing the spoil.</p>

<p>On the 17th of April, at six in the morning, the flotilla stood
to the north. We had not proceeded above four or five miles, when
we were obliged to stop and wait for one of the great canoes which
had sprung a leak, and was in momentary danger of sinking; the
sailors on board set about repairing it; they plunged into the
water with great agility and put oakum into the seams along the
keel. About three in the afternoon all was put to rights, and we
again pursued our course. The river was very wide and deep, and its
banks were naked and marshy; it took a little turn to the east, and
afterwards to the north: in every direction nothing was visible but
marshes, without trees of any kind. At sun-set the new moon was
saluted by several discharges of musketry, which so terrified the
Soorgoos, that they hastened ashore, and I heard some of them
exclaim in their little canoes, “God preserve us from gunpowder!”
The only arms used by these people, are lances and poniards. About
seven o’clock we passed Caratoo, a little village on the right
bank, and about nine, we stopped at an uninhabited place.</p>

<p>At five in the morning, of the 18th of April, we continued our
voyage. The river turned eastward, and at seven o’clock we found
its course changing to N. E.; it then became rather narrow, the
banks being all along very low and bare. The immense marshes on
both banks were covered with cattle belonging to the Soorgoos.
These herds as I have already observed, are their chief
property.</p>

<p>At eight in the morning we stopped to say the prayer of the
salam, it being the last day of the Ramadan, which the Mandingoes
call <i>Sali</i>. We were within sight of Cabra, and the negroes
testified their joy on perceiving the date trees of the village.
They put on their finest dress, assembled in a large plain, and
piously prostrated themselves in adoration of their God. I remained
in the canoe, and observed them through the holes that I had made
in the matting of my prison, where the heat was suffocating. I
congratulated myself that I was not required to join in these
religious ceremonies, and secretly offered up a prayer that my
enterprise might be favoured by Heaven. Their devotions being
ended, the negroes went to dinner, and good cheer compensated for
their past abstinence, which, however, had not been very rigorously
observed. An easterly wind obliged us to pass some part of the day
at this spot.</p>

<p>About four in the afternoon it became somewhat calm, and
preparations were made for pursuing our voyage; but the Soorgoos
opposed our departure until they had received four sacks of millet
from each boat, independently of the duties we should be obliged to
pay them on arriving at Cabra. This exaction on their part led to a
long discussion: all the masters of canoes gathered round the chief
of the flotilla, attended by the chiefs of the Soorgoos, and each
party defended their own interests and those of their employers
with considerable warmth. The Soorgoos were not inclined to abate
their demands; but, by dint of entreaty and resistance, the
contributions were reduced to one-half the amount which had been at
first demanded.</p>

<p>About nine in the evening the canoes received orders to send on
shore two sacks of millet; which was done without delay. These
sacks were of the height of a man, and as wide as the sacks
commonly used in France. I suppose they might contain nearly two
hundred pounds of grain. Never did any day appear to me so long and
tedious as this. I was almost within sight of Timbuctoo, and durst
not shew my face: I was obliged to hide myself the whole day; and,
if at any time the Soorgoos came on board, the crew obliged me to
muffle myself up in a large woollen wrapper, and to pretend to
sleep. At night I left my prison, for then the Soorgoos could not
distinguish my complexion from that of the negroes, and I breathed
the pure air until day-break.</p>

<p>On the 19th of April, at five in the morning, we stood to N. E.,
and at sun-rise passed a large branch of the river, which flows for
a short space to W. S .W. About seven o’clock we found ourselves
near a camp of Tooariks, the aspect of which was most miserable.
The tents which the Moors inhabit on the right bank of the Senegal
are palaces in comparison with the dwellings of these savages: a
few stakes, three or four feet high, supporting a covering of
untanned bulls’ hides, and encircled by mats, in the form of a
palisade, compose the abode of the chief, as well as of his meanest
sujects. The interior of these habitations appeared to correspond
perfectly with their exterior.</p>

<p>As we were very near the shore, I could observe a woman who had
the clear copper complexion of the Moorish females, whom she still
further resembled in dress: she was enormously fat, and was sitting
on a sheep-skin spread on the ground; she was doubtless amusing
herself by looking at the vessels as they passed. During my travels
among the Braknas I never saw a woman who had attained such a
degree of corpulency, though that quality constitutes the principal
charm of female beauty among these people. This Tooarik Venus must
have required four slaves at least to assist her in walking. The
river now turned a little to the east. After having passed the
camp, we came to a large island, off which we halted till eight
o’clock, having to wait for some boats, which could not proceed as
fast as ours. This island is very flat and sandy, but I observed
some specimens of the mimosa, <i>balanitis ægyptiaca</i>, and other
stunted shrubs.</p>

<p>About nine o’clock we again put off, and at ten arrived at a
place where the river separates into two branches: the principal of
these might be three-quarters of a mile broad, running gently E. S.
E.; the direction of the other is E. by N.; it is deep, and its
breadth is from thirty-five to forty paces.</p>

<p>About one o’clock <span class="sc2">P. M.</span> we arrived at
the port of Cabra, and I was informed that I might quit my prison,
the Soorgoos having remained behind; I speedily went on deck,
whence I could see nothing around me but flooded morasses covered
with aquatic birds. This arm of the river is very narrow, and the
current stronger than in the large arm. I think it not unlikely
that at a little distance it joins the Dhioliba, for in this place
the branch inclines to the east. If this is the case, the river
forms a large marshy island, which must be flooded during the
inundations.</p>

<p>Across these immense marshes is discovered the village or little
town of Cabra, situated on a small hill, which protects it from
inundation. I was told that in the rainy season these marshes are
covered with water to the depth of ten feet, which appeared to me a
surprising depth for so vast a space, and that at those periods
large vessels cast anchor before Cabra. A little canal leads to
this village; but small boats only can enter the port. If the canal
were cleared of the grass and nenuphars which choke the passage,
vessels of twenty-five tons burthen might go up it in all seasons;
but such a task would be too toilsome for the negroes.</p>

<p>I embarked on board a small canoe, in company with the Moors
from Adrar, to proceed to Cabra. The negro slaves hauled the canoe
along by a rope, as the pole would not have been sufficient to move
it. We met several small canoes which had been dispatched for the
purpose of conveying to the town the most valuable commodities
brought by the vessels from Jenné. About three in the afternoon we
reached Cabra, which is situated three miles to the north of the
great port. On entering it I observed a number of straw huts like
those of the Foulahs, which were inhabited by trading slaves. Near
their huts was a great quantity of the fruit of the nenuphar, which
constitutes part of the food of the slaves and poorer classes.</p>

<p>I observed in the streets a great concourse of people and
merchants; some walking idly about, others endeavouring to dispose
of their goods, consisting of fish, milk, colat-nuts, pistachios,
&amp;c. The town of Cabra is narrow, and extends east and west; the
houses are built of earth with terraced roofs, and have only a
ground-floor; few of them are well built, being chiefly cabins, for
the richer class of people prefer living at Timbuctoo, the centre
of commerce. The inhabitants of Cabra, about a thousand or twelve
hundred in number, are all employed, either in landing the various
merchandise brought from Jenné, or in conveying it to Timbuctoo.
For this purpose they make use of asses and camels. The slaves do
not carry loads on their heads; this would be a bad speculation for
their masters, for the poor creatures would soon be worn out, as
the road leading to the town consists of quicksand which renders
walking very difficult.</p>

<p>At Cabra a market is daily held for the sale of all sorts of
merchandise from Soudan. The town contains a little mosque,
surrounded by a tower or minaret. To the west of the town there are
some specimens of the <i>balanitis ægyptiaca</i>, and small gardens
of tobacco; this latter plant, however, does not thrive, and seldom
grows higher than six or seven inches. On the east side there are
some date-trees, which are visible from a distance.</p>

<p>The almost constant inundation of the marshes, in the
neighbourhood of Cabra prevents the inhabitants from cultivating
rice; and the sandy soil on the north is unfit for growing millet.
The Moors from Adrar, in whose boat I had come from the great port,
having unloaded the canoe, placed their goods in a store-house,
until they should be ready to convey them to the city. The
inhabitants of Cabra let their magazines to merchants, who wish to
deposit their goods in the town; and they also let out asses for
carrying loads to Timbuctoo.</p>

<p>I went out to take a view of the interior of the village. The
streets are narrow, but neat. I saw several female traders, and
from one of them I bought a little milk and a loaf of wheaten
flour, which cost me twenty cowries. I made a hearty breakfast, for
I had not tasted any thing all day. I had not cause to think much
of the honesty of the woman from whom I made the purchase, for she
wanted to make me pay twice. I was foolish enough to pay her
beforehand; it is the custom in this country to lay the value of
what is bought on the basket in which the goods lie, and the money
is not removed until the article is in the hands of the purchaser.
This precaution does not say much for the honesty of either buyers
or sellers.</p>

<p>I saw in the port a number of large canoes undergoing repair.
The owners are accustomed, as soon as the boats are unladen, to
draw them on shore, where they are supported on large round blocks
of wood, which keep them a little elevated from the ground. Were it
not for this prudent practice, the cords with which the planks are
fastened together would very quickly rot. The little port of Cabra
extends east and west for the space of half a mile, being about
sixty paces broad. It would be a very useful place, were it kept in
better order; but it is very dirty and full of mud. Numbers of men
and women are always ready in the port to load and unload the
vessels. This was the day for celebrating the conclusion of the
Ramadan. The inhabitants were dancing and indulging in their simple
demonstrations of joy. They were all decently clothed. I asked a
female slave, who was sitting before her hut, for some water to
drink. She immediately rose, and, washing a wooden bowl, brought me
some water in it, which she presented to me with great
civility.</p>

<p>The Soorgoos, or Tooariks, receive at Cabra the duties which
they levy on vessels. They roam about the village, and behave in
the most arbitrary way, making the inhabitants give them provisions
and other property—in fact, seizing whatever they can lay their
hands on. The inhabitants of Cabra took no notice of me. The Moors
of Adrar invited me to partake of their supper of rice, which I
found very palatable; and I passed the night in the open air,
sleeping on a mat beside my companions. I was a little tormented by
the mosquitoes, which, however, are not so common on the banks of
the Dhioliba as on those of the Senegal.</p>

<p>On the 25th of April, the merchants of Timbuctoo came to Cabra,
to land their goods. They were mounted on excellent horses.
Sidi-Abdallahi Chebir, to whom I had been directed by the sherif of
Jenné, did not come; but he sent his slaves. They were all well
clothed, and armed with a common kind of muskets, made at Tunis.
Sidi-Mbark, the owner of the canoe which had conveyed me to Cabra,
had arrived at Timbuctoo several days before us, and had mentioned
me to Sidi-Abdallah Chebir. He, consulting only the duty imposed on
him by his religion (for he had not yet received the letter of his
correspondent in my behalf) ordered his slaves to congratulate me
on my happy arrival, and to invite me to visit him. This message
led me to augur a good reception from him.</p>

<p>On the 20th of April, at half past three, I set out for
Timbuctoo, escorted by Sidi-Abdallah Chebir’s slaves. Our road lay
northward. The slaves who had been on board our canoe also
accompanied us, so that we formed a numerous caravan. The youngest
slaves were mounted upon asses, as the road is very sandy and
wearisome. Near Cabra we passed two lakes, the banks of which were
overgrown with mimosas from five to six feet high. A little further
the eye was refreshed by some signs of vegetation. The country
presented the same scenery until we had proceeded half way on our
journey, and then it began to be more naked, and the sand becoming
exceedingly loose, rendered travelling very difficult. On the road
we were followed by a Tooarik, mounted on a superb horse. This
marauder, who appeared to be about fifty years of age, shewed a
disposition to appropriate to himself a young negro slave.
Sidi-Abdallah Chebir’s men represented to him that the slave
belonged to their master, and that if, on arriving at the city, he
would pay him a visit, he would doubtless receive a present. This
appeared to satisfy him, and he ceased to molest us. He eyed me
narrowly, and several times inquired who I was, and whence I came.
They told him I was poor, and he relinquished the hope of getting
any thing from me.</p>

<p>At length, we arrived safely at Timbuctoo, just as the sun was
touching the horizon. I now saw this capital of the Soudan, to
reach which had so long been the object of my wishes. On entering
this mysterious city, which is an object of curiosity and research
to the civilised nations of Europe, I experienced an indescribable
satisfaction. I never before felt a similar emotion and my
transport was extreme. I was obliged, however to restrain my
feelings, and to God alone did I confide my joy. With what
gratitude did I return thanks to Heaven, for the happy result which
attended my enterprise! How many grateful thanksgivings did I pour
forth for the protection which God had vouchsafed to me, amidst
obstacles and dangers which appeared insurmountable. This duty
being ended, I looked around and found that the sight before me,
did not answer my expectations. I had formed a totally different
idea of the grandeur and wealth of Timbuctoo. The city presented,
at first view, nothing but a mass of ill-looking houses, built of
earth. Nothing was to be seen in all directions but immense plains
of quicksand of a yellowish white colour. The sky was a pale red as
far as the horizon: all nature wore a dreary aspect, and the most
profound silence prevailed; not even the warbling of a bird was to
be heard. Still, though I cannot account for the impression, there
was something imposing in the aspect of a great city, raised in the
midst of sands, and the difficulties surmounted by its founders
cannot fail to excite admiration. I am inclined to think, that
formerly the river flowed close to Timbuctoo; though at present it
is eight miles to the north of that city, and five miles from
Cabra, in the same direction.</p>

<p>I took up my abode with Sidi-Abdallahi, who received me in the
most friendly manner. He had already been indirectly acquainted
with the alleged circumstances, which, as I pretended, had
occasioned my journey across the Soudan. He invited me to sup with
him; and an excellent couscous of millet and mutton was served up.
Six of us partook of the dish, and we ate with our fingers; but in
as cleanly a way as was possible under such circumstances.
Sidi-Abdallahi, according to the custom of his countrymen, did not
say a word to me. He was a mild, quiet, reserved man. His age might
be about forty or forty-five. He was five feet high, stout and
pitted with the small-pox. His countenance was pleasing, his
manners grave, and rather dignified. He had no fault but his
religious fanaticism.</p>

<p>After bidding my host good night, I went to repose upon a mat
which was spread upon the ground in my new lodging. At Timbuctoo
the nights are as hot as the days, and I could get no rest in the
chamber which had been prepared for me. I removed to the court
adjoining the house, but still found it impossible to sleep. The
heat was oppressive; not a breath of air freshened the atmosphere.
In the whole course of my travels I never found myself more
uncomfortable.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 21st of April, I went to pay my respects
to my host, who received me with affability; afterwards I took a
turn round the city. I found it neither so large nor so populous as
I had expected. Its commerce is not so considerable as fame has
reported. There was not as at Jenné, a concourse of strangers from
all parts of the Soudan. I saw in the streets of Timbuctoo only the
camels, which had arrived from Cabra laden with the merchandise of
the flotilla, a few groups of the inhabitants sitting on mats,
conversing together, and Moors lying asleep in the shade before
their doors. In a word, every thing had a dull appearance.</p>

<p>I was surprised at the inactivity, I may even say, indolence,
displayed in the city. Some colat-nut venders were crying their
goods in the streets, as at Jenné.</p>

<p>About four in the afternoon, when the heat had diminished, I saw
several negro traders, all well clothed and mounted on good horses
richly harnessed, go out to ride. Prudence forbids them to venture
far from the city, for fear of the Tooariks, who would make them
pay dearly for their excursions.</p>

<p>In consequence of the oppressive heat the market is not held
until three in the afternoon. There were few strangers to be seen
except the Moors of the neighbouring tribe of Zawât, who often come
hither; but in comparison with Jenné, the market is a desert.</p>

<p>At Timbuctoo, it is very unusual to see any other merchandise
except what is brought by the vessels and a few articles from
Europe, such as glass wares, amber, coral, sulphur, paper,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>I saw three shops kept in small rooms, well stored with stuffs
of European manufacture. The merchants put out at their doors cakes
of salt for sale, but they never exhibit them in the market. Such
as do business at the market have stalls made of stakes covered
with mats, to protect them against the heat of the sun. My host
Sidi-Abdallahi was obliging enough to shew me over one of his
magazines in which he stowed his European merchandise. I observed
there many double-barrel guns, with the mark of Saint-Etienne, and
other manufactories. In general French muskets are much prized, and
sell at a higher rate than those of other nations. I also saw some
beautiful elephants’ teeth. My host told me that he procured some
from Jenné, but the larger ones had been bought at Timbuctoo; they
are brought hither by the Tooariks or Soorgoos, the Kissoors, and
the Dirimans, who inhabit the banks of the river. They do not hunt
the elephant with fire-arms, but catch it in snares. I regret
having never seen one of these animals caught.</p>

<p>On the 22nd of April, Sidi-Mbark, to whom I had made a present
of a piece of cloth with the view of gaining his friendship, told
me he should have a caravan ready in two days to go to Tafilet, and
that I must hold myself prepared to accompany him to the great
desert. This information vexed me, for I was not disposed to quit
Timbuctoo so soon. I did not, however, lose all hope of prolonging
my stay in that city.</p>

<p>In the evening I mentioned Mbark’s proposition to my host,
adding that I was greatly fatigued by the long journey I had
performed on foot, and that I wished to rest at Timbuctoo for about
a fortnight, after which I would avail myself of the first caravan
that might depart. I had scarcely expressed this wish, when he
interrupted me, saying in the kindest manner: “You may remain here
longer than a fortnight, if you please. You will gratify me by so
doing; you shall want for nothing.” I gratefully thanked him for
his generous hospitality. Shortly after I had another instance of
his kindness, for which I was very grateful. He had at first given
me a chamber to myself; but the Mandingo negro by whom I had been
so ill treated on board the canoe, on his arrival in Timbuctoo,
quartered himself and his female slave in my apartment. I bore this
patiently for some days; but the presence of the intruders
prevented me from taking my notes which I could only do in secret.
I mentioned to Sidi-Abdallahi that I should prefer being alone;
and, after reprimanding the negro, he lodged me in another house
belonging to him, which was near the marketplace and opposite to
that which had been occupied by Major Laing, the street only
intervening between them.</p>

<p>Often, when seated before my door, I thought of the fate of that
unfortunate traveller, who, after surmounting numberless dangers
and privations, was cruelly assassinated when on the eve of
returning to his country. In the course of these reflections I
could not repress a feeling of apprehension, lest, should I be
discovered, I might be doomed to a fate more horrible than death—to
slavery! But I determined to act with caution, and not to afford
any ground for suspicion.</p>

<p>I found myself much more comfortable in my new lodging.
Sidi-Abdallahi my host had directed a mat to be spread in my
chamber, of which he gave me the key. The slaves who lived in the
house were ordered to wait on me, and they brought me twice a day
couscous and rice seasoned with beef or mutton.</p>

<p>The city of Timbuctoo is principally inhabited by negroes of the
Kissoor nation. Many Moors also reside there. They are engaged in
trade, and, like Europeans, who repair to the colonies in the hope
of making their fortunes, they usually return to their own country
to enjoy the fruits of their industry. They have considerable
influence over the native inhabitants of Timbuctoo, whose king or
governor is a negro. This prince, who is named Osman, is much
respected by his subjects. He is very simple in his manners: his
dress is like that of the Moors of Morocco; and his house is no
better furnished than those of the Moorish merchants. He is himself
a merchant, and his sons trade with Jenné. He inherited a
considerable fortune from his ancestors, and is very rich. He has
four wives, besides an infinite number of slaves, and is a zealous
Mahometan.</p>

<p>The sovereignty is hereditary, descending to the eldest son. The
king does not levy any tribute on his subjects or on foreign
merchants, but he receives presents. There is no regular
government. The king is like a father ruling his children. He is
mild and just, and has nothing to fear from his subjects. The whole
community, indeed, exhibits the amiable and simple manners of the
patriarchs. In case of war, all are ready to serve; but the mild
and inoffensive manners of these people afford little ground for
quarrels, and when they arise the natives of Timbuctoo repair to
their chief, who assembles a council of the elders, all of whom are
blacks. Though the Moors are not permitted to take part in these
councils, yet my host Sidi-Abdallahi, the friend of Osman, was
sometimes allowed to be present at them. The Moors acknowledge a
superior among themselves; but they are, nevertheless, amenable to
the authorities of the country. I requested my host to present me
to the king, which, with his usual good-nature he consented to
do.</p>

<p>The prince received me in the midst of his court. He was seated
on a beautiful mat with a rich cushion. We seated ourselves for a
few moments at a little distance from him. Sidi-Abdallahi, after
briefly relating my adventures, told him that I wished to pay my
respects to him. I could not understand their conversation, for
they spoke in the language of the Kissoors. The king afterwards
addressed me in Arabic, asking some questions about the christians,
and the manner in which they had treated me. After a short time we
took our leave: I wished to have seen the interior of the house,
but my curiosity could not be gratified. The king appeared to be of
an exceedingly amiable disposition; his age might be about
fifty-five, and his hair was white and curly. He was of the
middling height, and his colour was jet black. He had an aquiline
nose, thin lips, a grey beard, and large eyes, and his whole
countenance was pleasing; his dress, like those of the Moors, was
composed of stuff of European manufacture. On his head was a red
cap, bound round with a large piece of muslin in the form of a
turban. His shoes were of morocco, shaped like our morning
slippers, and made in the country. He often visited the mosque.</p>

<p>There are, as I have already mentioned, many Moors in Timbuctoo,
and they occupy the finest houses in the city. They very soon
become rich in trade, and they receive consignments of merchandise
from Adrar, Tafilet, Tawât, Ardamas, Tripoli, Tunis, and Algiers.
They receive from Europe tobacco and other articles, which they
send by canoes to Jenné and elsewhere. Timbuctoo may be regarded as
the principal <i>entrepôt</i> of this part of Africa. All the salt
obtained from the mines of Toudeyni, is brought hither on camels.
The Moors of Morocco and other countries who travel to the Soudan,
remain six or eight months at Timbuctoo to sell their goods, and
get their camels re-laden.</p>

<p>The cakes of salt are tied together with cords, made of a sort
of grass which grows in the neighbourhood of Tandaye. This grass is
dry when gathered; but it is afterwards moistened, and then buried
under ground to keep it from the sun and the east wind, which would
dry it too rapidly. When sufficiently impregnated with moisture, it
is taken out of the earth and platted into cord, which the Moors
use for various purposes. The camels frequently throw their loads
off their backs, and when the cakes of salt arrive in the town they
are frequently broken. This would spoil their sale, if the
merchants did not take the precaution of making the slaves join
them together again. When the pieces are fastened together, the
cakes are packed up again with a stronger kind of cord made of
bull’s hide. The cakes are ornamented with little designs, such as
stripes, lozenges, &amp;c., traced in black. The slaves are very
fond of executing these ornaments, an employment which enables them
to collect a little supply of salt for their own use. In general,
the slaves are better treated at Timbuctoo than in other countries.
They are well clothed and fed, and seldom beaten. They are required
to observe religious duties, which they do very punctually; but
they are nevertheless regarded as merchandise, and are exported to
Tripoli, Morocco, and other parts of the coast, where they are not
so happy as at Timbuctoo. They always leave that place with regret,
though they are ignorant of the fate that awaits them
elsewhere.</p>

<p>At the time of my departure, I saw several slaves affectionately
bidding each other adieu. The conformity of their melancholy
condition excites among them a feeling of sympathy and mutual
interest. At parting, they recommended good behaviour to each
other; but the Moors frequently hurry their departure, and
interrupt these affecting scenes, which are so well calculated to
excite commiseration for their fate.</p>

<p>When I was at the mosque, a middle-aged Moor stepped up to me
gravely, and without saying a word slipped a handful of cowries
into the pocket of my coussabe. He withdrew immediately, without
affording me time to thank him. I was much surprised at this
delicate way of giving alms.</p>

<p>The city of Timbuctoo forms a sort of triangle, measuring about
three miles in circuit. The houses are large, but not high,
consisting entirely of a ground-floor. In some, a sort of little
closet is constructed above the entrance. They are built of bricks
of a round form, rolled in the hands, and baked in the sun. The
walls, except as far as regards their height, resemble those of
Jenné.</p>

<p>The streets of Timbuctoo are clean, and sufficiently wide to
permit three horsemen to pass abreast. Both within and without the
town there are many straw huts of a circular form, like those of
the pastoral Foulahs. They serve as dwellings for the poor, and for
the slaves who sell merchandise for their masters.</p>

<p>Timbuctoo contains seven mosques, two of which are large; each
is surmounted by a brick tower.</p>

<p>This mysterious city, which has been an object of curiosity for
so many ages, and of whose population, civilization, and trade with
the Soudan, such exaggerated notions have prevailed, is situated in
an immense plain of white sand, having no vegetation but stunted
trees and shrubs, such as the <i>mimosa ferruginea</i>, which grows
no higher than three or four feet. The city is not closed by any
barrier, and may be entered on any side. Within the town are seen
some of the <i>balanitis ægyptiaca</i>, and in the centre is a palm
tree.</p>

<p>Timbuctoo may contain at most about ten or twelve thousand
inhabitants; all are engaged in trade. The population is at times
augmented by the Arabs, who come with the caravans, and remain
awhile in the city. In the plain several species of grass and
thistles afford food for the camels. Fire-wood is very scarce,
being all brought from the neighbourhood of Cabra. It is an article
of trade, and the women sell it in the market-place. It is only
burnt by the rich; the poor use camel-dung for fuel. Water is also
sold in the market-place; the women give a measure containing about
half a pint for a cowrie.</p>

<p>Timbuctoo, though one of the largest cities I have seen in
Africa, possesses no other resources but its trade in salt, the
soil being totally unfit for cultivation. The inhabitants procure
from Jenné every thing requisite for the supply of their wants,
such as millet, rice, vegetable butter, honey, cotton, Soudan
cloth, preserved provisions, candles, soap, allspice, onions, dried
fish, pistachios, &amp;c.</p>

<p>If the vessels from Cabra should chance to be stopped by the
Tooariks, the inhabitants of Timbuctoo would be reduced to famine.
To obviate this misfortune, they take care to have their warehouses
always amply stored with every kind of provision. I saw the
magazines of Sidi-Abdallahi full of great sacks of rice, which
keeps better than millet.</p>

<p>For these reasons, the vessels which come down the river to
Cabra are deterred from making any resistance to the Tooariks,
notwithstanding the burthen of their exactions. I was assured that,
if the crews dared but to strike one of these savages, they would
forthwith declare war against Timbuctoo, and intercept all
communication with the port; the city could then receive no
supplies.</p>

<p>To the W. S. W. of the town there are large excavations, from
thirty-five to forty feet deep: these are reservoirs, which are
supplied by the rains. Hither the slaves resort to procure water
for drink and cooking. This water <a id="Page_58"></a>is tolerably
clear, but it has a disagreeable taste and is very hot.</p>

<p>These reservoirs had no covering whatever; the water is
consequently exposed to the influence of the sun and the hot wind.
The excavations are dug in loose sand. I descended into the largest
of them by a gentle declivity: the bottom was not quite covered
with water. I remarked some veins of hard red sand; with this
exception the soil was grey sand, of a coarsish grain.</p>

<p>Near the reservoirs are some small plantations of tobacco. This
plant grows here no higher than five or six inches, and that only
by dint of watering. It is the only cultivated vegetable that I
observed in this country. Some negroes were engaged in gathering
it; and I remarked that it had already run to seed. They dry the
leaves and pound them in a mortar, and then take the powder without
any further preparation. It is merely a green powder, and has not
even the smell of tobacco. They bring it to market; but the richer
class of people prefer that which comes from Morocco, which is of a
far better quality.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Timbuctoo do not smoke, but the wandering
Moors who dwell in the neighbourhood of the city use pipes.</p>

<p>The slaves draw the water from the reservoirs in calabashes,
with which they fill leathern bags, which are carried by asses.
Before they proceed to work, they always amuse themselves with a
short dance; for, in spite of their hard lot, they are constantly
full of gaiety. On their return home, they pour the water into
jars, where it cools and loses somewhat of its disagreeable taste.
I saw some female slaves washing in large calabashes beside the
reservoirs.</p>

<p>Two days’ journey N. E. of Timbuctoo stands the town of
Bousbéhey, built of bricks, made of a sandy clay. It belongs to the
tribe of Zawât, who wander in the desert of that name. The
inhabitants of Bousbéhey trade in salt, which they procure in the
small village of Toudeyni. They possess many camels, which
constitute their principal property: they drink their milk, of
which they also make butter. They possess a few sheep and some
horned cattle.</p>

<p>The merchants of Timbuctoo purchase cattle from these people,
and give in exchange millet and rice; for the soil of Bousbéhey is
totally barren, and scarcely furnishes fodder for the camels. The
Timbuctoo merchants likewise procure salt at Toudeyni, for which
they barter millet, rice, cloth, and gold.</p>

<p>Bousbéhey and Toudeyni, being only supplied with the grain which
the merchants of Timbuctoo receive from Jenné, would of course be
reduced to famine if the trade between the two latter cities should
be interrupted.</p>

<p>The country of Salah, which is inhabited by a wandering tribe
like that of Zawât, is situated on the east, and is ten days’
journey from Timbuctoo, whither the people of Salah often come for
the purpose of trade. They possess numerous herds of camels, the
milk of which, together with the grain they procure from Timbuctoo,
forms their subsistence. Sidi-Abdallahi informed me, that there was
no traffic or communication by water between Timbuctoo and the
country of Haoussa; because, said he, the navigation of the river
ceases at Cabra.</p>

<p>The negroes and Moors devote their attention exclusively to
trade: they possess but limited ideas of geography. All to whom I
applied for information respecting the course of the river to the
east and E. S. E. of Timbuctoo agreed in stating, that it runs to
Haoussa, and empties itself into the Nile.<a id=
"FNanchor_04"></a><a href="#Footnote_04" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> I
was unable to obtain any more accurate information on this point,
and the great problem of the issue of the Dhioliba into the ocean
will thus be left to the demonstration of some more fortunate
traveller; but, if I may be permitted to hazard an opinion as to
the course of the river, I should say, that it probably empties
itself by several mouths into the Gulf of Benin.</p>

<p>The Moors of Tripoli, as well as those of Ardamas, trade with
Haoussa, whither they carry European merchandise, and in exchange
bring back gold, which they procure in the rich country of Wangara;
they afterwards go to Timbuctoo with packages of the fine cloth of
Wangara, which is woven in narrow breadths, dyed a beautiful blue,
and well glazed with gum. Sidi-Abdallahi shewed me a beautiful
piece; it resembled the cloth manufactured by the negroes more to
the north. At Galam, in 1819, I saw a similar kind of cloth which
was brought from Sego, and was made by the Bambaras. It was as well
glazed as that which I saw at Timbuctoo. In general, the negroes of
the Senegal set a high value on this article.</p>

<p>As the country of Timbuctoo is entirely destitute of pasture,
(for even the camels can scarcely find food) the people obtain a
considerable quantity of fodder from Cabra, which the inhabitants
of that town grow in the marshes, and which they dry for the
purpose of selling to those who keep horses, cattle, sheep, and
goats. This forage is stowed on the roofs of the houses. Timbuctoo
and its environs present the most monotonous and barren scene I
ever beheld. I once indeed saw a herd of camels near the town
feeding here and there upon thistles which had been dried up by the
scorching east wind, and on branches of the <i>mimosa
ferruginea</i>, the long thorns of which did not prevent these
animals from devouring them. I was told that these camels belonged
to the Moors who journey across the great desert.</p>

<p>All the native inhabitants of Timbuctoo are zealous Mahometans;
their dress is similar to that of the Moors. Like the Arabs, they
are allowed to have four wives each. The women attend to domestic
occupations, and they are not like the Mandingo females, subject to
the punishment of beating. The people of Timbuctoo, who are in
constant communication with the half-civilized inhabitants of the
Mediterranean, have some idea of the dignity of human nature. I
have constantly observed in my travels, that in proportion as a
people was uncivilized the women were always more enslaved. The
female sex in Africa have reason to pray for the progress of
cultivation. The women of Timbuctoo are not veiled like those of
Morocco: they are allowed to go out when they please, and are at
liberty to see any one. The people are gentle and complaisant to
strangers. In trade they are industrious and intelligent; and the
traders are generally wealthy and have many slaves. The men are of
the ordinary size, well made, upright, and walk with a firm step.
Their colour is a fine deep black. Their noses are a little more
aquiline than those of the Mandigoes, and like them they have thin
lips and large eyes. I saw some women who might be considered
pretty. They are all well fed: their meals, of which they take two
a day, consist of rice, and couscous made of small millet, dressed
with meat or dried fish. Those negroes who are in easy
circumstances, like the Moors, breakfast on wheaten bread, tea, and
butter made from cow’s milk. Those of inferior condition use
vegetable butter. Generally speaking, the negroes are not so well
lodged as the Moors. The latter have great influence over them, and
indeed, consider themselves far their superiors.</p>

<p>WOMAN OF THE CITY OF TIMBUCTOO.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The inhabitants of Timbuctoo are exceedingly neat in their dress
and in the interior of their dwellings. Their domestic articles
consist of calabashes and wooden platters. They are unacquainted
with the use of knives and forks, and they believe that, like them,
all people in the world eat with their fingers. Their furniture
merely consists of mats for sitting on; and their beds are made by
fixing four stakes in the ground at one end of the room, and
stretching over them some mats or a cow-hide. The rich have cotton
mattresses, and coverlets, which the neighbouring Moors manufacture
from camel’s hair and sheep’s wool. I saw a woman of Cabra employed
in spinning these coverlets.</p>

<p>The natives of Timbuctoo, as I before observed, have several
wives, and to these many add their slaves. The Moors, indeed,
cohabit only with their slaves, and these females are employed in
vending merchandise in the streets, such as colats, allspice,
&amp;c. Some also have a little stall in the market-place, while
the favourite stays at home, superintending those whose business it
is to cook for the household: the favourite herself prepares the
husband’s meals. These women are very neatly dressed: their costume
consists of a coussabe, like that worn by the men, except that it
has not large sleeves. Their shoes are of morocco. The fashion of
the head-dress sometimes varies; it principally consists of a
<i>fatara</i> of fine muslin, or some other cotton stuff of
European manufacture. Their hair is beautifully platted. The
principal tress, which is about an inch thick, comes from the back
to the front of the head, and is terminated by a piece of cornelian
of a round form and concave in the centre; they put a little
cushion under the tress to support it, and add to that ornament
several other trinkets, made of imitation of amber or coral, and
bits of cornelian cut like that just mentioned. They also anoint
the head and the whole body with butter, but less profusely than
the Bambaras and the Mandingoes. The great heat, which is augmented
by the scorching east wind, renders this custom necessary. The
women of the richer class have always a great number of glass beads
about their necks and in their ears. Like the women of Jenné, they
wear nose-rings; and the female who is not rich enough to procure a
ring, substitutes a bit of red silk for it; they wear silver
bracelets, and ancle-rings of plated steel, the latter of which are
made in the country; instead of being round, like the bracelets,
are flat, and about four inches broad. Some pretty designs are
engraved on them.</p>

<p>The female slaves of rich masters have gold ornaments about
their necks; instead of wearing ear-rings as in the environs of the
Senegal, they have little plates in the form of a necklace. A few
days after my arrival at Timbuctoo I fell in with a negro, who was
parading about the streets two women, whom I recollected to have
been fellow-passengers with me on board the canoe. These women were
not young, but their master, to give them the appearance of an age
better suited to the market, had dressed them well. They wore fine
white pagnes, large gold ear-rings, and each had two or three
necklaces of the same metal. When I passed them, they looked at me,
and smiled. They did not appear in the least mortified at being
exhibited in the streets for sale, but manifested an indifference
which I could easily enough account for, by the state of
degradation to which they had been reduced and their total
ignorance of the natural rights of mankind. They thought that
tilings should be so, and that they had come into this world to be
bought and sold.</p>

<p>The negroes of the Diriman Malaka and Kissoor villages, situated
on the banks of the river, come to Timbuctoo in their canoes. They
bring to that market slaves, ivory, dried fish, earthen pots, and
various other articles, which they exchange for glass trinkets,
amber, coral and salt.</p>

<p>To the south of Timbuctoo there is a country called
<i>Ginbala</i>, which extends far inland. The inhabitants are, as I
was told, all Mahometans. They seldom come to Timbuctoo on account
of the Tooariks, whom they dread. They are very industrious, and
raise crops of millet and rice; they are hospitable to strangers,
and have numerous herds of horned cattle and flocks of sheep and
goats. They grow cotton, with which they manufacture stuffs for
clothing. Having nothing to fear in communicating with Jenné, they
prefer trading with that place.</p>

<p>The Foulahs who inhabit the neighbourhood of the river also
visit Timbuctoo. The few whom I happened to see were similar in
features and colour to those of the Fouta-Dhialon. They were armed
with several pikes.</p>

<p>The trade of Timbuctoo is considerably cramped by the Tooariks,
a warlike nation who render the inhabitants of the town their
tributaries. The latter, for the privilege of carrying on their
trade, give them what they demand, independently of the duties
levied on the flotillas at Cabra. A refusal to satisfy them would
be attended with serious consequences; for the Tooariks are very
numerous, and sufficiently strong to cut off all communication
between Cabra and Timbuctoo, when the city and its neighbourhood,
having within themselves no agricultural resources, would be
reduced to famine. The Moors entertain a profound contempt for the
Tooariks, and when they would express their utmost hatred of them,
they compare them to the christians, whom they suppose to be the
same kind of vagabonds and depredators. I endeavoured to refute
this error, which received implicit credit here. I assured them
that the Europeans were not to be compared to those marauders;
that, instead of robbing, they were always ready to assist and
succour their fellow creatures. “But if the christians are so very
good,” said they, “why did you not stay among them;” This question
embarrassed me a little; but I replied that God had ordained it
otherwise, and had inspired me with the idea of returning to my
country to resume the religion of my fathers.</p>

<p>The house of my host Sidi was constantly infested with Tooariks
and Arabs. These people visit Timbuctoo for the sole purpose of
extorting from the inhabitants what they call presents, but what
might be more properly called forced contributions. I have often
seen them sit in the court and insist on being supplied with food
until the master sent them his tribute. They always come on
horseback and their horses must be provided with forage.</p>

<p>When the chief of the Tooariks arrives with his suite at
Timbuctoo, it is a general calamity, and yet every one overwhelms
him with attention, and sends presents to him and his followers. He
sometimes remains there two months, being maintained all that time
at the expense of the inhabitants and the king, who sometimes give
them really valuable presents, and they return home laden with
millet, rice, honey, and preserved articles.</p>

<p>The Tooariks and Soorgoos are the same people: the former name
is given to them by the Moors and the latter by the negroes. They
are a wandering race, and inhabit the banks of the Dhioliba from
the village of Diré to the environs of Haoussa, which my host
informed me was twenty days’ journey E. by S. E. of Timbuctoo,
situated in a vast country of the same name, watered by the
river.</p>

<p>The Tooariks have terrified the negroes of their neighbourhood
into subjection, and they inflict upon them the most cruel
depredations and exactions. Like the Arabs, they have fine horses
which facilitate their marauding expeditions. The people exposed to
their attacks stand in such awe of them, that the appearance of
three or four Tooariks is sufficient to strike terror into five or
six villages. At Timbuctoo the slaves are never allowed to go out
of the town after sun-set, lest they should be carried off by the
Tooariks, who forcibly seize all who fall in their way. The
condition of these unhappy beings is then more deplorable than
ever. I saw some in the little canoes almost naked, and their
masters were constantly threatening to beat them.</p>

<p>The Tooariks possess numerous flocks of sheep and herds of oxen
and goats. Milk and meat are their only food. Their slaves gather
the seed of the nenuphar, which is very common in all the
surrounding marshes; they dry it and thrash it. It is so small that
it does not require bruising; they boil it with their fish. The
Tooariks cultivate no kind of vegetable. Their slaves are employed
in tending their flocks and herds. They have no grain for their own
use, except what they obtain from the flotillas passing from Jenné
to Timbuctoo. During the swell of the waters, the Tooariks retire a
little into the interior of the country, where they find good
pasture. They have numerous herds of camels, whose milk is always a
certain resource for them.</p>

<p>The Foulahs who live in the neighbourhood of the river are not
kept in subjection by these savages. The Foulahs are very superior
to the pure negro race; they are full of energy, and are too brave
to submit to the degrading yoke of the Tooariks. These Foulahs do
not speak the Poulh language of the Fouta-Dhialon. I addressed to
them some words in that dialect which they did not understand. They
speak the language of Timbuctoo; but they have also a particular
dialect which they use among themselves. All those whom I saw on
the banks of the river were rovers.</p>

<p>I sometimes saw the camels of the Tooariks employed in
transporting merchandise from Cabra to Timbuctoo; but only the
poorest among them would condescend to earn any thing by this sort
of labour. The rich are too proud to work. They sell at Timbuctoo
oxen and sheep for the usual consumption of the town. Milk is very
dear and not so good as on the banks of the river.</p>

<p>The Tooariks have, like all Mahometans, several wives. The
largest and the fattest are the most admired. To be a real beauty
with them, a woman must have such a degree of obesity as will
render her unable to walk without two assistants.</p>

<p>They are dressed like the Moorish women on the banks of the
Senegal; but instead of blue Guinea stuffs they wear blue pagnes,
which are brought from Jenné, and which the merchants of Timbuctoo
procure for them. Those I saw in passing the chief’s camp were very
dirty, and the men did not appear to be very careful about their
dress. Like the negroes of Timbuctoo, they wore a white or blue
coussabe, and trowsers reaching to the ancle, such as are worn at
Jenné and Timbuctoo. The slaves have breeches, like the Moors who
inhabit the banks of the Senegal. The dress of the Tooariks, except
as to the head, resembles that of the Moors. They wear, both night
and day, a band of cotton cloth, which passing over the forehead
hangs down over the eyes and even upon the nose, for they are
obliged to throw back the head a little to enable them to see.
After two or three turns round the head the band is passed under
the nose, and made to descend a little below the chin, so that only
the point of the nose is visible. They do not take it off either to
eat, to drink, or to smoke. On these occasions they merely lift up
this bandage, which the negroes call <i>fatara</i>.</p>

<p>The Tooariks are great smokers. They have all fine horses, which
they manage ably. They are as cruel as they are warlike. Their
weapons consist of three or four pikes and a poniard which they
wear on the left arm; the blade pointing upward and the hilt
touching the back of the hand. To the sheath of these poniards is
attached a kind of muff, through which the hand is passed; they are
straight and very well made. This weapon is brought from the banks
of the Mediterranean. These men also carry bucklers, of tanned
ox-hide, the workmanship of which is elegant. In their form they
resemble the shields of the ancient knights, except that they are
square at the extremities.<a id="FNanchor_05"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_05" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> They are adorned with
handsome designs, and are large enough to cover the whole body.
Some negroes of Timbuctoo have likewise bucklers of the same form,
but smaller. The only weapons of the Tooariks, who are always on
horseback, are the lance and the poniard. They do not use the bow,
as the management of their bucklers would prevent them from
employing that weapon advantageously. The people who compose this
wandering tribe have long hair and a very swarthy complexion, like
the Moors. The nose is aquiline, the eyes large, the mouth finely
formed, the face long, and the forehead rather elevated. The
expression of their countenance is, however, savage and barbarous.
They are supposed to be of Arab origin, and in fact, in some of
their customs they resemble that race; but they speak a particular
dialect. They assemble in force to attack the caravans from
Tripoli, but the Morocco caravans are less exposed to their
depredations because their haunts are more northerly. They keep
many slaves, whom they partly employ in collecting gum on the banks
of the river. This gum, and also considerable quantities of ivory,
they sell to the merchants of Timbuctoo.</p>

<p>It is astonishing that such a number of different tribes submit
quietly to the yoke of these Tooariks, when, were they to come to
an understanding, they could so easily rid themselves of their
troublesome enemy. The Dirimans, the Ginbalas, the Kissoors, and
the Moors of Zawâ and Salah, if united, would be greatly superior
to the Tooariks, and could soon deliver themselves from their
oppression. The Tooariks dread fire-arms, of which they make no
use, while the negroes of Timbuctoo and the Moors are armed with
double-barrel guns.</p>

<p>The Foulahs in the neighbourhood of Jenné, led by their chief
Sego-Ahmadoo, attacked the Tooariks; the Foulahs were few in
number, on account of their distance from their country, and the
difficulty of procuring supplies of provisions; nevertheless, they
defeated the Tooariks, made a number of prisoners, whom they put to
death, and carried off a multitude of slaves and cattle, which were
valuable prizes to the victors. This defeat proves, that there is
no good reason for the dread with which the Tooariks are regarded,
and that they are really formidable to those only who fear them.
Were these tributaries, supported by the Moors, to attempt to throw
off their yoke, they would quickly succeed; but, in general, the
negroes are indolent, and the Moors, being addicted to commerce,
have no martial character. Sego-Ahmadoo, indignant at seeing these
Tooariks, who are Mahometans, although certainly not very zealous
disciples of that creed, imposing a tax on the vessels from his
country, has determined to make war upon them; but he is too
distant to maintain a long war. I conjecture that Mungo Park was
murdered by these barbarians.</p>

<p>After residing four years at Jenné, or Timbuctoo, the Moors
return to their own country with a little fortune; they carry with
them a number of slaves; the greater part, however, prefer trading
with Sansanding and Yamina, on account of the vicinity of the gold
mines of Bouré, whence they obtain considerable supplies of this
precious metal. The Arabs, who come from Tafilet, Adrar, Tripoli,
and other countries, bring wheat to Timbuctoo: of the flour of this
wheat small leavened loaves are made; they are round, and weigh
about half a pound each; the bread is good, and a loaf may be
purchased for about forty cowries, (equal to four sous French
money). The rich merchants, as I believe I have already observed,
eat this bread at breakfast, with tea; they have tea services which
are brought from Morocco; those which I saw were made of tin, and
the cups were small, like Sidi-Ulad-Marmoo’s, at Jenné. All the
negroes of Timbuctoo are able to read the Koran, and even know it
by heart; they make their children begin to learn it very early,
whether they take upon themselves the task of instructing them, or
confide their education to the Moors, of whose abilities they have
a high opinion. They employ writing in their correspondence with
Jenné.</p>

<p>Provisions are very dear in Timbuctoo, and I should have been
greatly embarrassed if, as at Timé, I had been obliged to maintain
myself, for my means would have been soon exhausted. To the worthy
and generous Sidi-Abdallahi-Chebir, I was therefore indebted for my
return through the great desert. I had only merchandise to the
value of thirty-five piastres, which I reserved to buy a camel, to
carry me to the sea-coast, either through the great desert, or by
directing my course westerly. I confess that the idea of crossing
the Sahara in so dry a season was accompanied by not a little
alarm; I was afraid that, with my slight resources, I should not be
able to support the privations and fatigues of such a journey,
augmented, as they must be, by a scorching wind, which blows
unceasingly and renders the heat intolerable. However, after mature
reflection, I resolved to encounter the dangers to which the great
drought could not fail to expose me, and to venture with a caravan
among the moving sands of the desert. I reflected that if I should
return by the way of Sego, Sansanding, and our establishments at
Galam, those who might envy the success of my enterprise, the very
undertaking of which had created for me many enemies, would pretend
to doubt the fact of my journey and of my residence at Timbuctoo,
whereas, by returning through the Barbary states, the mere mention
of the point at which I had arrived would reduce the most malignant
to silence.</p>

<p>Sidi-Abdallahi daily lavished on me marks of his kindness; he
even went so far as to urge me to remain in Timbuctoo. He said he
would give me merchandise to trade on my own account; and,
observed, that when I should have accumulated sufficient profit, I
might return to my own country without assistance from any one.
However, the fear of being discovered, joined to a strong wish to
re-visit my native land, induced me to decline his generous offers.
I considered, moreover that, as my departure for the interior of
Africa was not authentically known, even that circumstance would be
buried in oblivion, were I to perish, and the observations I had
made would be lost to my country. Influenced by these
considerations, I resolved to endeavour to return as speedily as
possible. As the opportunity on which I relied, was likely to occur
soon, I did not neglect to take advantage of the short time which
would probably be at my disposal. I visited the great mosque on the
west side of the town; it is larger than that on the east, but is
built in the same style. The walls are in bad repair, their facing
being damaged by the rains, which fall in the months of August and
September, and which are always brought on by easterly winds,
accompanied by violent storms. Several buttresses are raised
against the wall to support them; I ascended the tower, though its
staircase, which is internal, is almost demolished. I returned
several times to make my notes, for in this little frequented spot
I was not afraid of being observed. During these travels, I always
endeavoured to conceal myself while writing, lest I should awaken
the suspicion of the Moslems: I always endeavoured to get into a
wood, or placed myself under the shade of a bush or a rock, when I
wished to commit what I thought worthy of remark to writing.<a id=
"FNanchor_06"></a><a href="#Footnote_06" class=
"fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>From the tower I had an extensive view over an immense plain of
white sand, on which nothing grows except a few stunted shrubs, the
<i>mimosa ferruginea</i>, and where the uniformity of the picture
is only here and there broken by some scattered hills or banks of
sand. I could not help contemplating with astonishment the
extraordinary city before me, created solely by the wants of
commerce, and destitute of every resource except what its
accidental position as a place of exchange affords. The western
quarter of the mosque seems very ancient, but the whole façade on
that side is in ruins. There are also some vaulted arcades, from
which the whole of the plaster facing is detached. This mosque is
constructed of sun-dried bricks, of nearly the same form as those
made in Europe. The walls are rough-cast with a kind of coarse
sand, similar to that of which the bricks are made, mixed with the
gluten of rice. In some parts of the desert there is found a very
hard ash-coloured earth, in which sand predominates. This earth has
been used in making the bricks for the mosque. The rest of the
edifice appears to have been built after the western part was in
ruins. Though the new part is very well for a people ignorant of
architecture, it is greatly inferior to the ancient remains.</p>

<p>I was surprised to find in the ancient part three galleries,
each supported by ten arcades, as well built as if they had been
the work of a skilful architect. The arches are six feet wide and
ten high; there the plaster is in an excellent state, and appears
to have been white-washed. The style and the position of this
building connect it with the ruins. I am inclined to think that the
mosque consisted originally of this part only, and that additions
were afterwards made to it.</p>

<p>The eastern part is composed of six galleries; those of the west
are supported by nineteen pillars. The apertures are each six feet
and a half wide, and ten or eleven high. The workmanship, though
pretty well executed, is, as I have already observed, far from
equalling that of the other quarter. The first three galleries on
the east side, are one hundred and four ordinary paces<a id=
"FNanchor_07"></a><a href="#Footnote_07" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
long, and about two and a half broad: the three next are only
sixty-four long. The length of those on the west is only thirty
nine paces. They lead to the great tower, which faces an inner
court, closed on the west by the ruins. It is of a square form, but
terminates in a small truncated pyramid, which is also built of
brick and surmounted by a pot of baked earth. Its height may be
estimated at fifty or fifty-five feet from the base to the summit.
The steps of the staircase, which is constructed internally, are
supported by pieces of wood fixed in the walls and covered with
earth. The dilapidated state of the staircase prevented me from
ascertaining the exact number of the steps, but I observed the
traces of thirty-two.</p>

AND FRONT OF THE HOUSE OF SIDI ABDALLAH CHEBIR, IN WHICH MR.
CAILLIÉ RESIDED.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The walls of the mosque are fifteen feet high and twenty-five or
twenty-six inches thick. The top of the wall of the east front is
indented in the form of battlements, the salient parts of which are
surmounted by pots of baked earth, similar to that on the summit of
the tower.</p>

<p>Another massive tower, of a conical form, surmounts the front
wall. It is about thirty feet high. On the dome, projecting pieces
of wood are perceptible, the use of which seems to be to unite the
masonry.</p>

<p>The roof of the mosque has a terrace like that of the tower, and
is moreover surrounded with a parapet eighteen inches high.</p>

<p>The roof of the building is supported by rafters, formed of the
trunks of the ronnier tree split into four, and placed at the
distance of a foot from each other. Pieces of salvadora wood,
brought from Cabra, where it grows in great abundance, cut to the
length of the intervals between the rafters, are placed obliquely
in double rows, crossing each other. Over these are laid mats made
of the leaves of the ronnier, which are covered with earth.</p>

<p>This mosque has five gates of different sizes on the eastern
side, three on the south side, and two on the north. On the western
side the ruins form at once the boundary of the mosque and of the
city. On the eastern and northern sides, the floor of the building
is level with the ground; but on the south is an ascent of four
steps.</p>

<p>On the eastern wall, in the interior of the building, there are
some ornaments made of yellow clay. They are in the form of a
chevron or triangular festoon, two feet high, with an opening of a
foot and a half. They commence about eighteen inches above the
ground. The pillars supporting the arcades in front, have some
ornaments of the same material tolerably executed, but very much
defaced. A kind of niche, in the centre of the eastern wall, is
destined for the marabout who officiates at prayers. In another
similar niche there is a large wooden pulpit, into which the priest
ascends by two or three steps, on the days when he reads certain
passages of the Koran. The floor of the mosque was covered with
mats, on which the people kneel during prayers.</p>

<p>Conceiving that the description alone would not convey an
adequate idea of the construction of this mosque, I ventured to
make a sketch of it, as well as of the town; both would, I thought,
convey a better idea than words alone of the objects with which I
wish to make the reader acquainted<a id="FNanchor_08"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_08" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>.</p>

<p>To make my sketch of the mosque, I sat down in the street in
front of it, and, covering myself in my large wrapper which I
folded over my knees, I held in my hand a sheet of white paper
close to a leaf of the Koran. When I perceived any one approaching,
I hid my drawing, and looking at the leaf of the Koran I appeared
to be absorbed in devotion. The passers-by, far from suspecting me,
regarded me as one of the elect, and applauded my zeal<a id=
"FNanchor_09"></a><a href="#Footnote_09" class=
"fnanchor">[9]</a>.</p>

<p>The eastern mosque is much smaller than that on the western
side. It is surmounted by a square tower, similar in form and
dimensions to that of the western mosque. The walls are entirely
stripped of their parget. Many buttresses have been erected to
support the building. It has three arcaded avenues. The galleries
are six feet wide and thirty feet long.</p>

<p>VIEW OF THE CITY OF TIMBUCTOO.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The mosque itself is thirty paces long and five and twenty wide.
The arcades which are three feet and a half wide and seven and a
half high are built of the same bricks as those of the western
mosque. There is an inner court, which must be passed through
before we can ascend the tower. No part of this mosque is in ruins,
though it appears very old. It is not very regularly built. I
remarked that it had two gates looking to the south and one to the
north. The western and eastern sides had no apertures. Near the
mosque, on the eastern side, are seen a small hillock of sand, and
some buildings overwhelmed by the sand blown up by the east
wind.</p>

<p>In the centre of the town is a kind of square surrounded by
circular huts. Here grow some <i>palmæ christi</i> and a palm-tree,
the only one I saw in the country. In the middle of this square is
a large hole, dug for a receptacle for filth. Two enormous heaps on
the outside of the town appeared to me to be also collections of
dirt or rubbish. Many a time have I ascended to the tops of these
hills to obtain a complete view of the town and to make my
sketch<a id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class=
"fnanchor">[10]</a>.</p>

<p>A third and somewhat remarkable mosque stands nearly in the
centre of the town. This likewise has a tower, but not so high as
those of the other two. It has square arcades: the naves are seven
feet wide and twenty five long. The front wall is ornamented with
many ostrich eggs, some of which are also placed on the top of the
tower. On the east side is a very extensive court, in the middle of
which a <i>balanites ægyptiaca</i> is planted by way of ornament.
At the back of the mosque on the opposite side, some
<i>salvadoras</i>.</p>

<p>There are five mosques besides those which I have mentioned; but
they are small and built like private houses, with the exception
that each is surmounted by a minaret; all of them have an inner
court, to which the people resort in the evening to perform their
religious devotions. The criers, whose business it is to call to
prayers, receive no salary; but at stated periods they announce to
the faithful from the summits of the minarets that it is time to
pay their contributions. I happened to be at Timbuctoo at one of
these periods. Each person made his offering, consisting of bread,
millet, rice, dried fish, pistachios and cowries; all these
articles were deposited on a mat spread on the ground, before the
door of the mosque.</p>

<p>It frequently happened that Moors who felt interested in my
situation questioned me about European customs and the treatment I
had experienced at the hands of the christians. I tried in my turn
to obtain from them information concerning the neighbouring nations
and the distance of their country from Timbuctoo. But, so far from
satisfying my curiosity, they pretended not to hear me, and turned
from me to speak to each other. Unfortunately, I had not the means
of gaining their favour by presents. They called me the
<i>meskine</i> (beggar). The little information I obtained at
Timbuctoo was furnished me by my host Sidi-Abdallahi-Chebir, and by
some Kissour negroes. These were the only individuals who had the
civility to reply to my questions. They had no definite idea of the
course of the river eastward of the city. Sidi assured me, that it
went to Haoussa and joined the Nile<a id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>. This is the general
opinion of the Arabs of this country. This river bears at Timbuctoo
the name of Bahar-el-Nil (Nile river).</p>

<p>The house which was appropriated for my residence not being
quite finished, I had opportunity to observe the way in which the
houses of this country are built. An excavation is made in the town
itself to the depth of some feet, where a grey sand mixed with clay
is found. This is made into bricks of a round form, which are baked
in the sun. These bricks are similar to those used at Jenné. The
young slaves carry them on their heads in calabashes, the way in
which they also carry the mortar, which is formed from the same
material. The builders, who are slaves, execute their work as
cleverly as those of Jenné. I thought indeed that their walls were
better constructed. Their doors are well made and solid; they are
formed of planks joined with bars and nails brought from Tafilet.
They fasten their doors by locks made in the country, without iron:
even the keys are of wood<a id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>. Some Moors use iron locks
and keys which they bring from the coasts of the Mediterranean.
Locks are not used in the interior of the houses; but chains or
bars supply their place. The roofs of the houses, none of which
have more than the ground-floor, are, like those of the mosques,
supported by rafters cut from the trunk of the ronnier, a tree
which grows to a prodigious height on the banks of the river. I
have seen some of these trees above a hundred and twenty five feet
high. The trunk is split into four quarters, which are rounded off,
laid upon the walls, and then covered with pieces of wood, mats and
earth, like the roofs of the mosques.</p>

<p>Each house forms a square,<a id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> containing two inner
courts, round which are ranged the chambers, each of which is of a
narrow oblong form and serves at once for a magazine and bed-room.
These rooms receive light only from the door of entrance, and
another very small door opening into the inner court. They have
neither windows nor chimneys.</p>

<p>The people of Timbuctoo have not adopted the practice, which is
general in the Soudan, of lighting fires in their houses. Some of
them build in the court a small hut of mats, in which during summer
they live day and night; the chambers being too warm.</p>

<p>A chamber similar to those I have above described was allotted
to me; but I had well nigh been suffocated in it. I found it
impossible to endure the heat, especially in the night. But what
could I do in a country where there is not a tree to cast the least
shade? My only refuge was a mosque which was the coolest and most
airy place I could find. The east wind too, by raising clouds of
dust, darkens the atmosphere and augments the heat. The inhabitants
stay within doors during the heat of the day, and only go out in
the mornings and evenings. The nights bring with them an oppressive
calmness of the atmosphere, and if by chance there is a breath of
air, it is felt like a burning vapour, and seems almost to scorch
the lungs. I was continually ill at Timbuctoo.</p>

<p>The caravan destined for Tafilet was not to leave Timbuctoo for
some days, and I was informed that the next did not start for three
months; I therefore determined to take advantage of the earliest
conveyance; for I dreaded so long a stay at Timbuctoo,
notwithstanding the reiterated invitations of Sidi-Abdallahi, who
recommended to me to take the route of Tripoli by Ardamas rather
than that of Morocco. He told me that he had intended to make a
collection for me, but that my speedy departure afforded him no
time to do so. He assured me that, if I would remain with him some
months, my subsistence should cost me nothing. I scarcely knew how
to decline such kindness, but I had formed my determination; I
excused myself to Sidi, by telling him that I was afraid to travel
in the rainy season, and finding me obstinate he looked out for a
good guide to conduct me to Tafilet.</p>

<p>The Moors in whose company I was about to travel were far from
being so kind and civilized as those who reside in the city. I had
had an opportunity of observing their manners before I started;
for, they often came and begged of me, and made no scruple of
rousing me out of my sleep. They are a class of men whom the Moors
of a superior order call <i>zenagues</i>, (tributaries). They are
very ignorant. Many of them do not know the first prayers of the
Koran. They however observe religious ceremonies. A poor stranger
like myself, unacquainted with their language, was in their eyes an
object of contempt. I expected therefore to suffer much in crossing
the desert.</p>

<p>Sidi-Abdallahi informed me that he had hired a camel to carry me
to Tafilet. The thirty thousand cowries’ worth of cloth, the
proceeds of the sale of my merchandise at Jenné, sufficed to pay
for the camel. Sidi told me that he would keep my cloth and give my
guide ten mitkhals of gold, or thirty piastres.</p>

<p>I employed the remainder of the time I stayed in Timbuctoo in
collecting information respecting the unfortunate death of Major
Laing, which I had heard mentioned at Jenné, and which was
confirmed by the inhabitants of Timbuctoo whom I questioned
respecting the melancholy event. I learned, that when within a few
days’ journey of the city, the caravan to which the major belonged
was stopped, on the road to Tripoli, by the Tooariks, or as others
alleged, by the Berbiches, a wandering tribe, near the Dhioliba.
Laing, being discovered to be a christian, was cruelly attacked,
and his assailants continued beating him with a club until they
thought him dead. I conclude that the other christian, who was said
to have been actually murdered, was a servant of the major’s.</p>

<p>The Moors belonging to the caravan raised Laing up, and
succeeded in restoring him to animation. When he became sensible,
they placed him upon a camel, but he was so weak that they were
obliged to tie him on. The robbers left him almost destitute,
having robbed him of the greater part of his merchandise.</p>

<p>On his arrival at Timbuctoo, Major Laing healed his wounds by
the aid of an ointment which he brought with him from England. His
recovery was slow; but he was made very comfortable, owing to the
letters of recommendation which he had brought from Tripoli, and
especially to the attention of his landlord, a Tripolitan, to whom
he had been directed. The house of this Moor was near that in which
I lodged at Timbuctoo. I had frequent opportunities of seeing him.
He appeared to me a man full of kindly feelings. Many a time he has
given me dates, from mere charity, and the day before I left he
made me a present of a pair of blue cotton trowsers, to wear on my
journey.</p>

<p>He told me that the major had been recommended by a Tripolitan
house to an old Moor, who, not having convenience to lodge him,
transferred him to his hospitality. Laing, he added, never laid
aside his European dress, and used to give out that he had been
sent by his master the King of England, for the purpose of making
himself acquainted with Timbuctoo and the wonders it
contains.<a id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class=
"fnanchor">[14]</a> It would appear that the traveller had openly
taken a plan of Timbuctoo, for the same Moor told me in his simple
way that <i>he had written down every thing in it</i>.</p>

<p>Other Moors, whom I questioned respecting Laing, merely told me
that the major ate little, and that he lived entirely on bread,
eggs, and poultry. I moreover learned that he was tormented to say
that there is but one God and that Mahomet is his prophet; but he
always stopped at the words: “There is but one God” They then
called him cafir, and infidel, but, without ill treating him, left
him free to think and pray in his own way. Sidi-Abdallahi, whom I
often questioned as to whether the major had been insulted during
his stay at Timbuctoo, always replied in the negative; shaking his
head, to give me to understand, that they would have been sorry to
annoy him.</p>

<p>This toleration may be accounted for by the fact, that the Moors
who reside at Timbuctoo come from Tripoli, Algiers, and Morocco,
and that, being in the habit of seeing christians in their own
countries, they are less liable to be offended at their worship and
their manners. For instance, Sidi-Abdallahi, who came from Tatta, a
town near Cape Mogador, was not inimical to the christians. Thus it
may easily be conceived that the major was free to inspect every
part of the town and even to enter the mosques.</p>

<p>It would appear that, after he had made himself completely
acquainted with Timbuctoo, he wished to see Cabra and the Dhioliba.
But had he left the city in the day time he would have incurred the
greatest danger from the Tooariks, who are continually roaming
about the environs of Timbuctoo, and whose attack he had too much
reason to remember. He determined to set off during the night. This
was wise, for though the Tooariks dared not touch him while he
staid in the town, they would have wrecked their vengeance on him
had they caught him beyond its limits, and murdered as well as
robbed him.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of a dark night, Major Laing mounted his horse,
and, unaccompanied by a single native, reached Cabra, and even, it
is said, the banks of the Dhioliba, without accident. On his return
to Timbuctoo, he ardently wished, instead of proceeding to Europe
by the desert, to travel by Jenné and Sego, ascending the Dhioliba,
whence he might have reached the French factories on the Senegal.
But, no sooner had he communicated his plan to the Foulahs
established on the borders of the Dhioliba; (a great number of whom
had resorted to Timbuctoo, on hearing of the arrival of a
christian) than they all declared they would never suffer a
<i>nasarah</i> to set foot in their territory, and if he made the
attempt, they warned him that he would have cause to repent it.</p>

<p>The major, perceiving that he could do nothing with these
fanatics, chose the rout of el-Arawan, where he hoped to join a
caravan of Moorish merchants, conveying salt to Sansanding; but
alas! after journeying five days to the north of Timbuctoo, the
caravan with which he had come up was stopped by Sheikh
Hamet-oul’d-Habib, an old fanatic, chief of the tribe of Zawât, who
wander in the desert of that name. Sheikh Hamet seized the major,
under pretence of his having entered his territory without
permission. He then wished to compel him to acknowledge Mahomet to
be prophet of God, and required him even to make the salam. Laing
relying too confidently on the protection of the pacha of Tripoli,
who had recommended him to all the sheikhs of the desert, refused
to obey Hamet, who more and more urgently insisted on his
acknowledging himself a Musulman. Laing continued firm, and chose
to die rather than yield; a resolution which made one of the most
intelligent of travellers a martyr to the cause of science. A Moor,
belonging to the train of the chief of the Zawâts, who was directed
by his master to kill the christian, refused to execute his order.
“What!” said he, “do you wish me to slay the first christian who
has come among us, and one who has done us no injury? give the
commission to another; I will not be the instrument of his death;
kill him yourself.” This address suspended for a moment the fatal
sentence, and the question of Laing’s life or death was warmly
debated for some time. At length the latter was decided on. Some
black slaves were summoned, and they were ordered to perform the
horrid deed, with which the Moor had refused to stain his hands.
One of the murderers immediately tied his turban round the neck of
the victim, and strangled him on the spot, he pulling one end while
his comrade held the other. The corpse of the unfortunate Laing was
cast upon the desert, to become the prey of the raven and the
vulture, the only birds which inhabit those desolate regions.</p>

<p>When the major had once been discovered to be a christian and a
European, death was a thousand times preferable to even a temporary
change of religion, since he must have renounced all hope of again
visiting Europe. The fate of Laing, had he become a Musulman
perforce, would have been irremediably wretched. He would have been
the slave of merciless barbarians, and exposed to all the miseries
and dangers peculiar to that country; in vain would the pacha of
Tripoli have demanded his liberation. At that immense distance, the
chief of the Zawâts would have scorned his menaces and detained his
prisoner. The resolution of Major Laing was perhaps at once a proof
of intrepidity and of foresight.</p>

<p>On his departure for El-Arawan the major took with him some
astronomical instruments and his papers, but very little
merchandise, for the Tooariks had relieved him of nearly all he
possessed. The Sheikh Hamet therefore gained little by the murder
of the English traveller, and he was even obliged to divide that
little with the wretches whom he had made the instruments of his
crime. A Moor of Tafilet, who belonged to the caravan, had for his
share of the spoil a sextant, which I was informed might be found
in the country. As for the major’s papers and journals, they were
scattered among the inhabitants of the desert. During my stay at
Gourland, a village of Tafilet, I saw a copper pocket compass, of
English manufacture. Nobody could tell me whence this instrument
had come, and I concluded that it had belonged to Laing. Had it not
been for the precautions I was compelled to observe in my Arabic
disguise, I would have given a good price for it; but I could not,
without betraying myself, show that I attached the least value to
an instrument, of the use of which I was supposed to be
ignorant.</p>

<p>I have left a wide field of discovery for those who come after
me, especially in the geography and natural history of this
country. What I have suffered should not discourage future
enquirers. Their attempts will doubtless be attended with hardships
and danger; but an enterprise conducted with prudence would triumph
over obstacles. To ensure success, the traveller should, I think,
make no sort of display; he should externally adopt the worship of
Mahomet, and pass himself off for an Arab. A pretended convert
would not enjoy so much liberty, and would be an object of
suspicion to such distrustful people. Besides, I am of opinion that
a converted christian would not be tolerated among the negro
tribes. The best plan would be, I think to cross the great desert
of Sahara in the character of an Arab, provided with adequate but
concealed resources. After remaining for some time in the Musulman
town selected by the traveller as his starting point, where he
might give himself out as a merchant, to avoid suspicion, he might
purchase some merchandise in that town, under the pretence of going
to trade further on, carefully abstaining from all mention of the
city of Timbuctoo.</p>

<p>Let us suppose Tangiers or Arbate to be the place chosen as the
point of departure; mercantile business at Fez might be alleged as
an excuse for setting off. Still adopting the same pretence, the
traveller might proceed from Fez to Tafilet, and thence to
Timbuctoo. At Tafilet there would be no danger of speaking of
Timbuctoo, for there a journey to the Soudan is an affair of
frequent occurrence and it excites no attention. It would be
advisable to purchase merchandise at Tafilet for the purpose of
exportation. On reaching Timbuctoo, the traveller should settle
there, establish a mercantile house; but he should above all things
avoid appearing rich, and must make himself familiar with the
customs of the country, and be very circumspect in every thing
connected with religion.</p>

<p>After remaining at Timbuctoo seventeen or eighteen months, and
purchasing some Mandingo or Bambara slaves speaking the Kissour and
Tooarik languages, he might procure a middle-sized well built
canoe, for the conveyance of merchandise and provisions. It would
be necessary to take a supply of the latter, on account of the
uncertainty of being able to procure them from the people who dwell
on the banks of the river. By promising the slaves their liberty,
they might be easily prevailed upon to undertake the voyage, the
pretended object of which would be to trade in the lower part of
the river, and to purchase gum, ivory, &amp;c. It would not be
necessary to adopt all these precautions for the passage of the
river above Cabra.</p>

<p>To lull suspicion, it would be advisable to leave at Timbuctoo a
certain quantity of merchandise, under the care of a confidential
slave, who might have orders to dispose of it under the direction
of a Moorish merchant, during his master’s absence.</p>

<p>Being once fairly embarked in the canoe with six slaves, good
swimmers, it would be preferable to proceed onward during the night
on account of the wandering tribes of Tooariks and others. But even
if they were met during the day time, they might be got rid of with
a few presents. This course, prudently and cautiously followed,
would, I doubt not, be attended with complete success, and it
appears to me preferable to the plan of sending numerous
expeditions, which would rouse the cupidity and distrust of the
natives.</p>

<p>The rapid passage of the little canoe would render the voyage
infinitely less fatiguing and dangerous than if performed in a
large vessel. Sidi-Abdallahi informed me that Haoussa was only a
twenty days’ passage from Timbuctoo, descending the river; but in a
small canoe the passage might be accomplished in twelve days, and
then the mouth of the river might be speedily reached, especially
if it empties itself into the Ocean. This plan, I am convinced,
would be far less dangerous than that of starting from the gulf of
Benin, where great difficulties would always be experienced in
ascending, both on account of the climate and the inhabitants.</p>

<p>On parting with my host, I thanked him for his generous
hospitality: though he had often declared that all the care he took
of me was for the love of God and the prophet, I offered him the
woollen wrapper which I bought at Kakondy, and which had been so
useful to me during my long illness at Timé; I also offered him the
<i>satala</i> or vase which I used for my ablutions. Contrary to my
expectation, this excellent man declined receiving my offered
presents, observing that I should want those articles in the course
of my journey, and that I ought not to be deprived of them. At
last, overcome by my solicitations, he consented to accept them;
but, the day before my departure, he, in his turn, presented me
with a cotton wrapper manufactured in the Soudan, and which was of
equal value with the one I had given him. He added to this handsome
present a new cotton coussabe also, that I might have a change of
dress on my journey. This was not all, he presented me with a stock
of provisions sufficient to last till I reached El-Arawan; and he
paid all the expenses of my journey to that place, warmly
recommending me to one of the inhabitants, who was his agent,
during the stay I should make there before I crossed the great
desert. In short, he spared no pains to diminish the hardships of
that undertaking. He also gave me two leathern bottles to hold my
supply of water for the journey; some dokhnou, wheaten bread, baked
in the same way as our biscuit, melted butter, and a large quantity
of rice.</p>

<p>It was very warm during the whole of the fortnight that I stayed
at Timbuctoo; the wind never ceased to blow from the east.</p>

<p>The caravan destined for el-Arawan, with which I had resolved to
travel, was to set out on the 4th of May, at sun-rise. My host was
up so early that morning as to allow me time, before my departure,
to breakfast with him on tea, new bread, and butter. That nothing
might diminish the agreeable impression which my stay at Timbuctoo
had made upon me, I met, on departing, the host of Major Laing, who
made me accept some new clothing for my journey.</p>

<p>Sidi-Abdallahi accompanied me to some distance from his house,
and, at parting with me, he affectionately pressed my hand and
wished me a good journey. This farewell detained me almost too
long. To rejoin the caravan, which had already proceeded to a
considerable distance, I was obliged, as well as three slaves who
had also remained behind, to run a whole mile through the sand.
This effort fatigued me so much, that, on reaching the caravan, I
fell down in a state of insensibility; I was lifted up and placed
on a loaded camel, where I sat among the packages, and though
dreadfully shaken I was too glad at being relieved from the labour
of walking to complain of my beast.</p>

<p>On the 4th of May, 1828, at eight in the morning, we directed
our route to the north over a sandy soil, almost moving, quite
level, and completely barren. However, at the distance of two miles
from the town, we met with a few shrubs resembling junipers, and
some rather tall clusters of <i>mimosa ferruginea</i>, which yield
a gum of inferior quality. The inhabitants of Timbuctoo send their
slaves hither for fire-wood. The heat was most oppressive, and the
progress of the camels was extremely slow; for, as they moved
along, they browsed on the thistles and withered herbs, which they
found scattered here and there on these plains. During this first
day the slaves were allowed to drink at discretion, as I was. This
conduct was doubtless very humane; nevertheless, I was soon shocked
by an act of barbarity, which I had the misfortune to see too often
repeated. A poor Bambara slave of twenty-five was cruelly treated
by some Moors, who compelled him to walk, without allowing him to
halt for a moment, or to quench his burning thirst. The complaints
of this unfortunate creature, who had never been accustomed to
endure such extraordinary privations, might have moved the hardest
heart. Sometimes he would beg to rest himself against the crupper
of a camel, and at others he threw himself down on the sand in
despair. In vain did he implore, with uplifted hands, a drop of
water; his cruel masters answered his prayers and his tears only
with stripes.</p>

<p>At Timbuctoo the merchants give the slaves shirts, such as are
worn in the country, that they may be decently covered; but on the
route the Moors of the caravans, who are the most barbarous men I
ever knew, take the good shirts from them and give them others all
in rags.</p>

<p>At five in the evening the caravan, the camels of which amounted
to nearly six hundred, halted in a ravine of yellow sand, which
was, however, pretty solid. Here these animals found some herbage,
and the spot appeared to me delightful. A slave, who was barely
allowed time to take a drink of water, was ordered to look after
our camels, and we thought of nothing but how to pass the night
quietly; but before we laid ourselves down to sleep, we made our
supper on a calabash of water, some dokhnou, and the bread which I
had received from Sidi-Abdallahi; the bread being hard we soaked it
in the water, into which we put a little butter and honey. This
mixture was to us a delicious beverage. The slaves had for their
supper some sangleh seasoned with butter and salt. These
good-natured creatures were so kind as to offer me some of their
meal.</p>

<p>On the 5th of May, at sun-rise, we resumed our journey. We still
proceeded towards the north, upon ground similar to that over which
we passed on the preceding day. A few stunted bushes were descried
here and there, and also some salvadoras, which the camels
devoured.</p>

<p>Towards noon we approached a less level region, where the ground
was raised into slightly elevated mounds, all inclining in the
direction from east to west. The heat was suffocating, on account
of the east wind, which raised great clouds of sand: our lips were
covered with it; our thirst became insupportable; and our
sufferings increased in proportion as we advanced further in the
desert. We fell in with two Tooariks, who were going to el-Arawan,
and whom we took to be the scouts of a troop of these marauders.
Fortunately they were alone. They were both mounted on one camel.
On the left arm they had a leather buckler; by the side, a poniard;
and in the right hand, a pike. Knowing that they should meet us in
their route, they had brought no provisions with them, and trusted
to the caravan for a supply. These robbers, who would have trembled
at the slightest menace, if seriously made, took advantage of the
terror which their name and the crimes of their tribe every where
spread, and obtained whatever they demanded: in a word, the best of
every thing was presented to them. On the one hand, there was a
sort of rivalship in offering them whatever they chose to eat; on
the other, to give them water, though it would be six days before
we should come to any. At last, after they had staid with us three
days, we had the satisfaction to see them depart, and to be
delivered from their troublesome company.</p>

<p>At four in the evening we encamped to pass the night, during
which we were oppressed by excessive heat, caused by a dead calm.
The sky was heavy and covered with clouds which seemed immoveable
in the immensity of space. Still the heat continued intense.</p>

<p>Before proceeding farther, I ought to inform the reader how I
continued to make an estimate of the route. We travelled, at an
average, about two miles an hour. At night we proceeded almost
constantly in a northerly direction. Being afraid that my pocket
compass would be noticed if I took it out to consult it, I judged
of our course during the day by the sun; in the night, by the
pole-star.</p>

<p>It is by this star that the Arabs are guided in all their
excursions through the desert. The oldest caravan conductors go
first, to lead the way. A sand-hill, a rock, a difference of colour
in the sand, a few tufts of herbage, are infallible marks, which
enable them to recognize their situation. Though without a compass,
or any instrument for observation, they possess so completely the
habit of noticing the most minute things, that they never go
astray, though they have no path traced out for them, and though
the wind in an instant completely covers with sand and obliterates
the track of the camels.</p>

<p>The desert, however, does not always present the same aspect,
or, consequently the same difficulties. In some parts I found it
covered with rocks and gravel, which bore the traces of caravans
that had passed long before. Besides, though the desert is a plain
of sand and rock, the Arab commits few errors in crossing it, and
is seldom wrong to the extent of half an hour in fixing the time of
arrival at the wells. I ought not to omit to mention, that these
wells are almost constantly found covered over, and that the first
thing done on the arrival of a caravan is to clear away the
sand.</p>

<p>On the 6th of May we resumed our march, at three in the morning,
and continued our route to the north. Still the same soil, the same
aridity, and the same uniformity, as on the preceding days.</p>

<p>The atmosphere was very heavy all day, and the heat excessive.
It seemed as if we should have rain. The sun, concealed by clouds,
appeared only at long intervals. But our prayers did not obtain
from Heaven a drop of rain. In spite of all the prognostics no
shower fell. The further northward we proceeded the more barren the
country became. We no longer saw either thistles or salvadoras: sad
consolations, where all nature wears so frightful an aspect! The
plain had here the precise appearance of the ocean; perhaps such as
the bed of a sea would have, if left by the water. In fact, the
winds form in the sand undulating furrows, like the waves of the
sea when a breeze slightly ruffles its surface. At the sight of
this dismal spectacle, of this awful abandonment and nakedness, I
forgot for a moment my hardships, to reflect on the violent
convulsions which thus appeared to have dried up part of the ocean,
and of the sudden catastrophes which have changed the face of our
globe.</p>

<p>At eleven in the morning we halted. The heat was insupportable,
and we seated ourselves beside some unhealthy looking mimosas, over
which we extended our wrappers, for these shrubs being destitute of
leaves afforded no shade of themselves. Under our tents thus
formed, we had distributed to us a calabash of water, which was
rendered tepid by the east wind. According to our custom, we threw
into the water some handfuls of dokhnou. Finally, to relieve
ourselves from every immediate care, we sent a slave to watch our
camels, which were endeavouring to refresh themselves by browsing
on some withered herbage. We then lay down to sleep on the sand,
which at this place was covered with small stones. This was not
done from indolence, but from consideration; for it was proper to
wait for night to take advantage of the coolness, when we might
travel more at our ease than during the day, in which the calms
were sometimes more insupportable than the burning sun. During
these calms I could not close my eyes, while the Moors slept
soundly. The same kind of calm often prevails during the night, but
then there is some compensation in the absence of the sun. In the
inhabited countries, the night, or rather the latter part of the
night, is always the most agreeable portion of the twenty-four
hours. It is at day-break that the flowers exhale all their
perfumes: the air is then gently agitated, and the birds commence
their songs. Recollections, at once pleasing and painful, turned my
thoughts to the south. In the midst of this frightful desert could
I fail to regret the land which nature has embellished?</p>

<p>The caravans which traverse the desert are under no absolute
commander; every one manages his camels as he pleases, whether he
has many or few; some have fifteen, others six or ten; and there
are individuals who possess not more than three; I have even seen
some with only two, but these were very poor. Such persons join
richer travellers and take care of their camels; in return, they
are supplied with provisions and water during the journey.</p>

<p>The Moors always lay out the profits of their journeys in the
purchase of camels, and none of them travel to Timbuctoo without
possessing at least one. The camels do not advance in files, as
they would do in our roads lined by hedges and cultivated lands. On
the contrary they move in all directions, in groupes, or single,
but in this journey their route is always between N. N. E. and N.
N. W. Those which belong to one master keep together, and do not
mix with strange camels; and I have seen as many as fifty grouped
together in this way. A camel’s load is five hundred pounds, and
the carriage from Timbuctoo to Tafilet costs ten or twelve gold
mitkhals,<a id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class=
"fnanchor">[15]</a> which are paid in advance.</p>

<p>The camels which convey merchandise of light weight, such as
ostrich feathers, clothes, and stuffs in the piece, have their
loads made up with slaves, water, and rice; for, the load being
paid for according to its weight, the proprietors of the camels, if
that weight were not completed, would gain nothing by the carriage
of merchandise more cumbersome than heavy. When the caravan stops,
the groupes of camels are kept at the distance of two hundred paces
from each other, to obviate the confusion which would arise if they
were suffered to mix together.</p>

<p>When the Moors return to their country, they do not carry back
merely ostrich feathers and ivory; but they take also gold, some
more, and some less. I saw some who had as much as the value of a
hundred mitkhals. This gold is generally sent to the merchants of
Tafilet by their correspondents at Timbuctoo, in return for the
merchandise sent by the former, and sold on their account by the
latter. During our halts in the deserts, I often saw the Moors
weighing their gold in little scales similar to ours, which are
made in Morocco. The gold which is conveyed by these travelling
clerks of the desert is carefully rolled up in pieces of cloth,
with a label, on which are written the weight of the metal and the
name of the individual to whom it belongs.</p>

<p>When night set in, we took our usual supper, consisting of
water, bread, butter, and honey. Several Moors, with whom we were
not acquainted, came and asked us for a supper; they then invited
the two Moors who were of our party to share their mess of baked
rice and butter. Though they knew that they had partaken of my
provisions, yet they did not think proper to invite me, a proof,
that notwithstanding all my efforts, there existed a feeling of
distrust towards me. At sun-set a north breeze arose, which, though
not very cool, was nevertheless very reviving, and enabled me to
enjoy a little sleep.</p>

<p>About eleven at night we set out, still proceeding northward,
and directing our course by the pole-star. The camels are so well
acquainted with the desert that, as soon as they are loaded, they
take, as if by instinct, the northern course. It would seem that
they are guided by the recollection of the springs of water which
are found in that direction. I really believe that a traveller,
though alone, might safely trust himself to the guidance of his
camel.</p>

<p>The night was hot and calm, and the clear sky was studded with
stars. We had before us the great and the little wain which
appeared very near the horizon. As I could not sleep, I amused
myself by observing the courses of the stars; I saw in the east the
remarkable groupe called the constellation of Orion; I watched it
during nearly half its course, almost to our zenith. On the
approach of day, the stars disappeared and seemed to sink into an
ocean of sand.</p>

<p>The camels never accelerate their pace, which is naturally
somewhat tardy. When they are in haste, they thrust forward their
necks, the motion of which corresponds with that of their legs.
They are led by men on foot, whose labour is so fatiguing, that it
is necessary to relieve them every two hours.</p>

<p>The ground over which we travelled during the night appeared to
me to be even more barren than that which we had passed on the
preceding days. For whole hours in succession we did not see a
single blade of grass.</p>

<p>At eleven in the morning the heat became excessive, and we
halted at a place where we found a few little banks of sand. A
slave was sent to seek out a few bushes that might afford us shade,
but no such thing was to be discovered. The reflection of the rays
of the sun on the sand augmented the heat. It was impossible to
stand barefoot on the sand without experiencing intolerable pain.
The desert is here and there interspersed with a few hills, and we
found at very distant intervals a little grass for the camels.</p>

<p>We had been the whole of the morning without drink, and as soon
as our tents were pitched we slaked our thirst. Our water began to
diminish in proportion as our thirst increased, therefore we did
not cook any thing for supper, but merely drank a little dokhnou.
About eleven at night we broke up our camp and proceeded northward:
at seven in the morning we turned N. N. W.</p>

<p>At eleven o’clock on the 8th of May, the insupportable heat
obliged us to halt on a spot as flat and barren as that at which we
had stopped on the preceding day. We pitched our tents, and
assembled beneath them. Some drink was distributed to us; and, as
we had tasted none since five o’clock on the preceding evening, our
thirst was very great. Though the water had received a bad taste
from the leathern bag, it was nevertheless exceedingly grateful. I
observed some ravens and vultures, the only inhabitants of these
deserts. They subsist on the carcases of the camels that die and
are left behind on the road. At half past six in the evening, after
having refreshed ourselves with a glass of water and dokhnou, we
proceeded on our journey. We travelled all night in a northerly
direction. The camels, finding no pasture, went on without
stopping.</p>

<p>About 8 o’clock on the morning of the 9th of May, we halted in a
sandy plain, where we found a little grass for our poor camels.
There we perceived at a distance the camels of el-Arawan.</p>

<p>In the morning, little before sun-rise, the Moors who
accompanied me shewed me the spot where Major Laing was murdered. I
there observed the site of a camp. I averted my eyes from this
scene of horror, and secretly dropped a tear—the only tribute of
regret I could render to the ill-fated traveller, to whose memory
no monument will ever be reared on the spot where he perished.</p>

<p>Several Moors of our caravan, who had witnessed the fatal event,
told me that the major had but little property with him when he was
stopped by the chief of the Zawâts, and that he had offered five
hundred piastres to a Moor to conduct him to Souyerah (Mogador).
This the Moor refused to do, for what reason I was not informed,
and I dared not inquire. They also spoke of the sextant, which I
have mentioned above.</p>

<p>Having pitched our tents near some water, we could drink as much
as we pleased. Rice was boiled for our dinner and we were somewhat
indemnified for the privations we had undergone in the preceding
days. At six in the evening we proceeded northwards over a very
level sandy soil, on which were scattered a few solitary patches of
vegetation. Though the sand has a tolerable consistency, yet not a
tree was to be seen. Towards nine in the evening, we arrived at
El-Arawan, another commercial entrepot. We encamped outside the
city, and in the neighbourhood I observed several tents and camels,
which I was told belonged to the caravan, waiting for the signal
for departure. Our arrival was greeted by the howling of dogs, a
circumstance which reminded me that I had seen none of those
animals at Timbuctoo.</p>

<p>Being unaccustomed to riding on camels, I found myself extremely
fatigued by the journey. The moment we stopped, I spread my wrapper
upon the sand, and fell into a profound sleep. I did not find the
heat so oppressive as it had been on the preceding days. I was
roused to partake of an excellent couscous brought from the
city.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 10th of May my guide took me to his
correspondent Kalif, to whom I had been recommended in a private
letter from Sidi-Abdallahi-Chebir. I met with a favourable
reception, and he lodged me in one of his houses, where he had some
slaves and merchandise.</p>

<p>As soon as I was installed in my new dwelling, my guide, who had
been very attentive to me on the journey, wished through my
influence to get himself quartered upon Kalif; but I refused to
make any such proposal to my host, lest I should appear
troublesome. Finding me obstinate on this point, he asked me to
lend him my cotton wrapper to wear while he paraded about the town
to visit his acquaintance. I consented to this in order to get rid
of him; but next day, I thought it prudent to make him return my
wrapper. Another time he told me that he had been robbed of the
wooden bowl, out of which he used to drink on the journey, and
earnestly begged me to ask my host for one and give it him. Wearied
by all these demands and not knowing how to get rid of the
troublesome fellow, I gave him a flat refusal; but that did not
deter him from coming very often to partake of my repast of rice
and couscous. This man was continually asking the slaves, whether
they had any provisions or other articles to sell, a practise by
which he and others like him often induced the poor creatures to
plunder their masters.</p>

<p>My host sent me, about eleven o’clock in the morning, a plate of
well flavoured rice and meat, and about eight in the evening a
plate of couscous for my supper. The water for my drink was
brackish and luke-warm.</p>

<p>On the 11th and following days, I inspected the town of
El-Arawan. It is situated in a hollow, and surrounded by sandy
hills, which extend to the west. The streets are wider than those
of Timbuctoo, and equally clean. The houses, built in the same
manner as at Timbuctoo, are much lower and less solid; for the sand
here is not of so clayey a nature. The roofs are flat; instead of
the small pieces of wood, which are used in the buildings at
Timbuctoo, they here substitute the stalks of a bullrush which
grows in the neighbourhood of the town. Thin rafters of ronnier
wood support these reeds, which are slightly covered with sand. The
magazines are very small. The houses are all of very frail
construction, and their number may be five hundred, each containing
about six inhabitants, including slaves. Before the doors is
sprinkled a yellow kind of sand, which is found by digging to a
certain depth.</p>

<p>El-Arawan, like Timbuctoo, possesses no resources of its own. It
is the entrepot of the salt of Toudeyni, which is exported to
Sansanding, on the banks of the Dhioliba. Its soil is even more
barren than that of Timbuctoo. As far as the eye can reach, no
trace of vegetation is to be perceived. The camels of the numerous
caravans have to go a great distance for forage. Wood is so scarce,
that nothing is burned but camel-dung, which is carefully collected
by the slaves. This is the only fuel used even for cooking. The
Moors collect their camels every six days, in order to take them to
drink at the wells, which are in the environs of the town. These
wells are about sixty paces deep. They employ a camel to draw up
the bucket, which is made of hide. A pulley is also used. The water
of these wells is brackish, warm, and very unwholesome. The springs
are numerous. At the depth of four feet from the surface is found a
grey sand mixed with a little clay of the same colour. This sand is
tolerably firm. At the bottom of the pits there is a very white
kind of earth, resembling chalk, of which I carried away a
specimen. There are also some black and grey pebbles, and a small
quantity of calcareous stones, of which the Moors make a brim round
the wells. The place in which they are dug is flat, and surrounded
by large hillock of sand. I have often seen the Moors employed in
watering their camels. They have a trough of tanned hide, which
stands on three supports of twisted wood. For drawing up the water
they use a rope made of straw, first damped and beaten and
afterwards twisted. Though water when kept in the houses is always
exposed to a current of air, it is invariably warm, and
consequently very disagreeable for drinking.</p>

<p>Many Moors and negroes, impelled by curiosity, followed me in
the streets. Some asked for snuff; in vain did I assure them that I
had none, and never used any, they would not relinquish the attack,
and they called me christian as the greatest insult they could
offer me. Their vociferations were accompanied by threatening
gestures. I began to fear that I should lose my temper, and that
the affair might become serious. I hastened back to my lodging,
into which my assailants followed me. An old Moor took pity on me,
and reproached them for their behaviour, assuring them that I was a
Musulman and a stranger, and under the protection of Kalif, who
would be indignant at my being ill treated. He finally succeeded in
dispersing them.</p>

<p>I found a great difference between the inhabitants of this place
and those of Timbuctoo, where I had been well received by the
Moors. The people of El-Arawan, on the other hand, looked upon me
with suspicion. They could not believe, that after having passed my
youth among the christians, I should voluntarily forsake their
customs and resume those of my kindred. Fortunately for me, some
old men more zealous, or credulous, than the rest, declared that
God would support me in the way of salvation, since he had inspired
me with so astonishing a resolution. They added in Arabic, “Let us
thank God, that he has returned among us.”</p>

<p>These disagreeable occurrences induced me to appear more zealous
than hitherto. I went regularly to the mosque, but, when I
prostrated myself, like the disciples of the prophet, I offered up
fervent prayers to God, thus endeavouring <a id="Page_101"></a>to
atone for the painful sacrifice of my religion which I was
outwardly compelled to make.</p>

<p>El-Arawan is not a place of such active trade as Timbuctoo,
whence all provisions for the former place are brought, Sansanding,
which is twenty-five days’ journey to the west, being too far
distant to afford supplies. I was told, indeed, by several Moors,
that the journey occupied a month.</p>

<p>El-Arawan sends, as I have before said, the salt of the mines of
Toudeyni to Sansanding and Jamina, by caravans of Moorish
merchants, who also carry tobacco, which is cultivated in Tafilet
and Zawât.</p>

<p>This town, though inhabited by the Moors of Zawât<a id=
"FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
and the different countries on the banks of the Mediterranean, has
no market. I never saw so dull a place. In the interior of the town
there are, as at Timbuctoo straw huts for the slaves.</p>

<p>Bousbéhey, of which I have already spoken, is two days’ journey
distant from El-Arawan, and the inhabitants of the latter place
purchase cattle there, as in all parts of the interior of Africa
there are no markets. Each family kills a bullock from time to time
and cures the meat, by drying it in the sun. It is eaten with rice
or couscous.</p>

<p>Though the great distance of Sansanding does not permit the
inhabitants of El-Arawan to go thither for millet, they procure
from that place more valuable articles, such as ivory, gold,
slaves, wax, honey, the cloths of Soudan, and cured provisions.
Rice is also transported thence in small quantities. Cowries, which
are the current money of Soudan, do not pass at El-Arawan. There
nothing circulates but gold and silver—neat pieces of the value of
a mitkhal, in imitation of the money of Morocco. The gold mitkhal
increases in value as you approach the coasts.</p>

<p>El-Arawan is the point for the arrival of the caravans from
Tafilet, Cape Mogador, Drah, Tawât, and the cities of Aghdâmus and
Tripoli. They bring merchandise of European manufacture, such as
fire-arms, gunpowder, stuffs, and a few productions of their own
countries, as tobacco, dates, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Kalif, who was one of the principal merchants of El-Arawan, was
a native of Tawât, and he received from his country merchandise
which he sent to the Dhioliba. The caravans which perform this
journey are seven days without procuring water; after which they
reach the banks of the river, which I was informed is very wide at
that part.</p>

<p>I supposed it to be the banks of the lake Débo. At a short
distance from this place which is not inhabited, negro villages are
met with as far as Sansanding.</p>

<p>In the rainy season, which occurs at the same time as at
Timbuctoo the inhabitants of El-Arawan are visited by the Touariks,
who come and pitch their tents in the environs of the city, and
collect the duties which they impose on traders. These duties are
not so exorbitant as at Timbuctoo. The Touariks observe some
moderation at El-Arawan, on account of its distance from their
country.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the town are all fanatical Moors; they have
numerous slaves, which they purchase at Sansanding, and,
notwithstanding the natural brutality of the people, they treat
their slaves kindly; they allow them plenty of food, consisting of
sangleh, which is eaten with a sauce made of dried baobab leaves,
boiled and seasoned with salt or allspice. They also clothe them
well. If to the misery incidental to this wretched country were
added the bad treatment which slaves experience in some parts of
the desert, the poor creatures could not long survive.</p>

<p>An old Moor named Sidi-Boubacar is the chief of El-Arawan; he
acts as judge in all the differences which arise among the
inhabitants. At his death his son succeeds him. The Mahometan chief
levies no duties on the people. He is himself a merchant and
possesses considerable herds of camels. In the rainy season, when
forage becomes more abundant, the inhabitants use camels’ milk as
an article of food.</p>

<p>On the 14th of May, a violent gale blew from the east, which
unroofed several of the houses, and raised such a quantity of sand,
that it was impossible to keep the doors open. The heat, though
there was no sun, was stifling. The air was full of sand, which
descended in the night. It would be impossible to express what I
suffered during this storm. I was obliged to lie on the ground,
with my head enveloped in a pagne, to protect myself from the
burning sand, which entered through the chinks in the door. I
experienced a continual thirst, and had nothing but warm and
brackish water to quench it. This unwholesome drink caused a
violent derangement of the stomach, and the heat, rising to a
degree I had never before felt, produced a dreadful head-ache.</p>

<p>The slaves, obliged sometimes to walk barefoot on the sand,
complained of violent pain, which they were not able to bear long,
but which soon compelled them to return home. The Moors stay within
doors, keeping a piece of cloth constantly before their lips, to
prevent the sand from getting into their mouths. I was unable to
comprehend how the mere love of gain could induce these people to
live for twelve or fifteen years in such a dreadful country.</p>

<p>The town of Walet, mentioned by Mungo Park, is ten days’ journey
W. N. W. of El-Arawan. Some Moors, whom I saw, told me, that no
water is to be met with on the road, and that this town carries on
a great traffic in salt with Sansanding, Yamina, and Ségo. This
last place is five days’ journey to the south; salt, which is its
principal article of trade is obtained from the mines of
Waden,<a id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class=
"fnanchor">[17]</a> situated in the great desert, fifteen or
eighteen days’ journey north of Walet. This salt is made up in
cakes of the same dimensions as those of Toudeyni. The inhabitants
keep a great many camels, as well as a few goats and sheep. Walet
is situated on a barren soil, not susceptible of cultivation, and
the inhabitants buy corn in the Bambara country. I was told that
this town is as large as Timbuctoo. I questioned some Moors
respecting Tichit, but was unable to obtain any positive
information on the subject.</p>

<p>During my stay at El-Arawan the same scorching east wind
continually prevailed and obliged me to keep myself within doors,
which vexed me not a little.</p>

<p>The caravans which were assembled at El-Arawan prepared to
depart in a few days. I looked forward with pleasure to the happy
moment when I was to leave this disagreeable country. My host, a
zealous Musulman, laid in a supply of provisions for my journey. It
was neither to his generosity nor his friendship for me that I owed
this attention;—it was purely a sacrifice, which his piety prompted
him to make in order to conciliate the favour of the prophet. The
provisions consisted of a bag of rice weighing about fifty pounds,
a bag of dokhnou of the same weight, and about ten pounds of
butter. This was more than sufficient to last me two months.
Wishing to make some acknowledgment for the attention of Kalif, I
offered him some pieces of silver, a pair of scissors, and a small
piece of cloth, the only one I had left. The good Musulman at first
affected an unwillingness to accept my presents, saying that I was
poor, and that probably the things would be useful to me, and that
what he had done for me was solely with the view of serving God. He
however put the silver in his pocket, and was apparently much
pleased with that sort of money which is very uncommon in this
country. He sent my provisions to the tent of Sidi-Aly, a Moor,
with whom I was to go to Tafilet. This man, whom
Sidi-Abdallahi-Chébir had recommended to me, had received on
departing from Timbuctoo ten gold mitkhals (equal to 120 francs)
for my expenses in the desert.</p>

<p>A Moor, who was settled at El-Arawan, and with whom I used
frequently to converse, made me a present of a skin to enable me to
increase my supply of water. He informed me that I should suffer
much from thirst on the journey, and that for seven or eight days
we should meet with no wells. The description he gave of crossing
the desert at this season made me shudder. I thought I should
certainly share the fate of the many unfortunate travellers who had
perished there. However I rallied my courage, by dwelling on the
hope of relating in my native country the result of my
observations. I then no longer thought any difficulty
insurmontable.</p>

<p>Sidi-Aly, whom I had not seen at Timbuctoo, and to whom
Sidi-Abdallahi, my host, had strongly recommended me, gave me
extraordinary proofs of his regard. He assured me that he would
treat me as his son. He confirmed the report I had previously heard
respecting the scarcity of water on the road, and stated that we
should have to undergo great privations, but that I must not be
disheartened, as he would take care of me, seeing that I was not
like the rest, accustomed to the heat of the desert, and could not
so well bear the excessive thirst, to which we should often be
exposed. This person was looked upon by the Moors as a zealous
Musulman. I was assured that he feared God, and that he would act
towards me as he had promised. Sidi-Aly always carried in his hand
a rosary two feet and a half long, the beads of which were as large
as nuts. He never failed, when he met any one in the streets, to
cast his eyes piously on the ground, at the same time moving his
lips, as if he were muttering a prayer. By this hypocrisy he
imposed on me, as he did on others, and I believed that he was as
good as he pretended to be; but I was cruelly deceived.
Notwithstanding his feigned zeal for religion, the old hypocrite
did not keep one of the promises he made me, as will be seen in the
sequel.</p>

<p>We left El-Arawan on the 19th of May 1828, at six o’clock in the
morning. Aly, my guide, had sent his son to carry my luggage to the
place appointed for the rendezvous of the caravan. My host had
invited me to share his repast; but as it was not cooked, I was
obliged to set off without tasting anything but a little dokhnou
and millet. He again recommended me to my guide, and took his leave
of me after wishing me a prosperous journey. It was about half past
seven, when the caravan began to move to the N. E. I was concerned
to see the poor slaves, whom I recognized as having been my
companions from Jenné to El-Arawan, running through the sand to
overtake the camels, which were in advance.</p>

<p>Our caravan was numerous: it consisted of fourteen hundred
camels, laden with the various productions of the Soudan; as gold,
slaves, ivory, gum, ostrich-feathers, and cloth in the piece and
made into dresses. In leaving El-Arawan the road leads over a sandy
country, with but few traces of vegetation. After proceeding six
miles in this direction, we arrived at Mourat, a small village,
containing five houses like those of El-Arawan, and built of sand
bricks. At Mourat, the sons of Sidi-Boubacar, chief of El-Arawan,
keep a school, where the children of the inhabitants of the town
study the Koran. Mourat appeared to me even more gloomy than
El-Arawan; the uniformity of the soil is broken only by a few
plants, which are eaten by the camels, and which are buried beneath
the sand, drifted by the east wind. On leaving Mourat, the
traveller comes to some deep wells filled with brackish water. Here
our caravan stopped and took a hearty draught, for we were now
about to enter upon a part of the desert where we should find no
water for the space of eight days. In the midst of these vast
deserts, the wells of Mourat, surrounded by fourteen hundred
camels, and by the four hundred men of our caravan, who were
crowded round them, presented the moving picture of a populous
town; it was a perfect tumult of men and beasts. On one side were
camels laden with ivory, gum, and bales of goods of all sorts; on
the other, camels carrying on their backs negroes, men, women, and
children, who were on their way to be sold at the Morocco market;
and further on, men prostrate on the ground, invoking the
prophet.</p>

<p>This spectacle touched and excited my feelings, and in imitation
of the devout Musulmans, I fell on my knees; but it was to pray to
the God of the Christians: with my eyes turned to the north,
towards my country, my relations, and friends, I besought the
Almighty to remove from my path the obstacles which had stopped so
many other travellers; in the ardour of my wishes, I imagined that
my prayer was granted, and that I should be the first European who
had set out from the south of Africa, to cross this ocean of sand,
and succeeded in the undertaking. The thought electrified me; and
while a gloom hung on all other faces, mine was radiant with hope
and joy. Full of these sentiments I hastened to mount my camel, and
to penetrate fearlessly into the deserts which separate the fertile
Soudan from the regions of northern Africa. I felt as if I was
mounting the breach of an impregnable fort, and that it was
incumbent upon me to sustain the honour of my nation, by divesting
myself of every kind of fear and braving this new peril.</p>

<p>A boundless horizon was already expanded before us, and we could
distinguish nothing but an immense plain of shining sand, and over
it a burning sky. At this sight the camels uttered long moans, the
slaves became sullen and silent, and, with their eyes turned
towards heaven, they appeared to be tortured with regret for the
loss of their country, and with the recollection of the verdant
plains from which avarice and cruelty had snatched them.</p>
<br>

<h2><a id="chap23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<p class="chap_sum_small">Violence of the east winds — Pillars of
sand — Scarcity of water — Deplorable situation of the caravan —
Hills of loose sand — Rocks of granite — Wells of Telig — Toudeyni,
rich salt mines — Thistle of the desert — Vexations and
persecutions of the Moors, their intolerance — Wells of Cramès —
Well of Trasas or Trarzas — Trajacant Moors.</p>

<p>We continued our route to the north a little west, through a
district uniformly arid, interspersed with little sand-hills, in a
direction from east to west. The east wind had now subsided, and
the heat was excessive on account of the calm. We were tormented
with thirst, for we only drank once in the course of the day. I
derived some benefit from the care I took, after the example of the
Moors, to fasten a strip of cotton cloth over my eyes, and another
over my mouth to keep off the burning air which parched my
lungs.</p>

<p>In the course of the day, we had passed over grey and red gravel
in many places. Towards half past five we halted on unvaried sand;
and a large calabash of water mixed with dokhnou was brought to us.
We had eaten nothing all day, and yet we felt no need of food; for
the dokhnou is very nourishing, and the burning thirst with which
we were tormented had taken away every thing like hunger. A Moor
was sent to take care of the camels, which were wandering here and
there in search of a few blades of grass.</p>

<p>About ten at night, we had some rice cooked, which we ate with
melted butter; but it made me very thirsty. I begged for a little
water; but old Aly, my guide, who had remained behind, no doubt
that he might drink as much as he liked himself without being seen,
came up at the moment they were preparing to give me the water, and
peremptorily countermanded it. This was only a prelude to the
annoyance he afterwards caused me.</p>

<p>On the 20th of May, at five in the morning, we continued our
course to the north, the country being of the same nature, as that
which we traversed the day before. About ten o’clock we halted in a
place which was absolutely bare. The heat was beginning to be
excessive, and we hastened to stretch the covering (a tanned
sheep-skin which served for a tent) under which we collected for
the rest of the day. We had each a calabash of water containing
about three bottles which we swallowed at a draught; but this tepid
water only filled the stomach without quenching our thirst: I would
fain have drunk oftener, and a smaller quantity at a time, but the
Moors who presided over the distribution of the water would not
hear of this new arrangement, and adhered to the old practice.</p>

<p>The poor negro slaves, accustomed to a fertile country, suffered
from this way of life, but they were no worse off than the rest of
us; we were all on an equality.</p>

<p>It was not yet noon, and we were to have nothing to eat or drink
till five in the evening. The heat was excessive and the east wind
raised a great quantity of sand, as it had done most days; we
suffered dreadfully. At the moment when I was thinking of nothing
but the present calamity, old Aly came to inform me that the
water-skins which Sidi-Abdallahi of Timbuctoo had given me were not
large enough, and that our provision of water would not last long
if we were not extremely economical. The rogue was right; for
whilst I had three skins for my share, he and his companions had
only two small ones a-piece, and there were nine persons to be
supplied for a week. I was certainly entitled to forbid their
making use of my stock; but what should I have been the better if I
had? they would have drunk the water, and told me the east wind had
dried it up. I answered therefore that I was obliged to Aly for his
information, and that I should take his advice. During this
conversation, which was followed up on my part by many painful
reflections, the east wind increased; it was no longer a time for
talking of one’s affairs, but every one lay down to sleep, as we
intended to travel during the night. My eyes never closed, and I
lay wide awake. The east wind continued till sunset and then
changed to the west; though its force was abated, it hardly
incommoded us less, for it still blew up a great quantity of
sand.</p>

<p>At five o’clock we had a calabash of dokhnou, and then lay down
again till nine, when we started. We marched all night; and the
calm was stifling, for the west wind had ceased. The country
through which we travelled was quite level and absolutely barren.
The slow and unvaried step of the camel made me drowsy. I laid my
head upon my bag, and slept a little.</p>

<p>On the 21st, at ten o’clock in the morning, we halted. The
burning east wind which was beginning to blow rendered the heat
insufferable, and the scorching sand found its way into our eyes,
in spite of the precautions which we took to exclude it. We pitched
our tents, and tepid water was distributed, which we thought
delicious though it had little effect in quenching our thirst;
after we had drunk it, we stretched ourselves on the sand to
repose. Notwithstanding all the precautions I had taken, the heat
was so intense and my thirst so tormenting, that I found if
impossible to get any sleep; my throat was on fire and my tongue
clave to the roof of my mouth. I lay as if expiring on the sand,
waiting with the greatest impatience for the moment when we were to
have our next supply of water; I thought of nothing but
water—rivers, streams, rivulets, were the only ideas that presented
themselves to my mind during this burning fever; in my impatience I
cursed my companions, the country, the camels, and for anything I
know the sun himself, who did not make sufficient speed to reach
the horizon.</p>

<p>The spot where we were encamped was frightfully arid, there was
not a single leaf to refresh the eye, and nature presented her most
terrific aspect.</p>

<p>The camels scattered over the plain, the profound solitude, the
silence of the desert, produced painful impressions, which it is
difficult to describe; the poor animals, exhausted with fatigue,
were lying near the tents, with their heads between their legs,
quietly waiting for the signal of departure; it was given at last.
At half past four Sidi-Aly who had undertaken to provide our
rations, threw a few handfuls of dokhnou into a large calabash, and
poured water upon it; he then mixed the whole with his hands,
thrusting his arms in up to the elbows—a sight which would have
disgusted any one less hungry than ourselves, for water was so
precious that old Aly’s hands had not been washed for many days.
Though the beverage was luke-warm, and very dirty, we drank
heartily of it, and with the greatest delight.</p>

<p>When the Moors had quenched their thirst, they went to look
after the baggage, and to see that none of the straps had given
way. In spite of this examination, which is repeated at every
halting-place, the camels are often galled by their loads, and
these hurts are not easily healed; the Moors apply fire to the
wounds, and often scarify the neighbouring parts and the tumours
themselves, to let out the blood and matter; they cut away the dead
flesh, and cover the wound with salt to prevent mortification. When
a camel is ill, or ready to die of exhaustion, the Moors give it a
little water, and for this purpose they use a wooden funnel which
they apply to its nostrils; this is the best method of watering a
camel, because the animal, though naturally docile, shakes its head
about and spills the water on all sides, when it is applied to its
mouth. It is only in cases of extremity however that they have
recourse to this practice.</p>

<p>Sometimes it was immediately after doctoring the wounds of his
camels that Sidi-Aly came and mixed our beverage without washing
his hands; if by chance he did wash them, he gave the water he had
used for this purpose to his poor slave to drink! I cannot describe
the horror and disgust which I felt at this man’s contempt for his
fellow-creatures.</p>

<p>At five o’clock in the afternoon, we pursued our course towards
the north; at ten we stopped for prayer, and having discharged this
pious duty, we received a ration of water, very insufficient
however to quench our thirst; for the further we advanced into the
desert, the more intense became the heat. In the night I was almost
consumed with thirst; but I could get no water. I doubled myself up
upon my camel, whose motion lulled me and made me feel drowsy, but
I could get no sleep.</p>

<p>On the 22d of May, at nine in the morning, the caravan halted;
we were all exhausted by thirst; the east wind was hotter than
ever, and our water was rapidly diminishing, for the wind caused a
great evaporation by drying the skins; and a great deal of water
filtered through the pores. As I lay on the sand, I ruminated on
the possibility of alleviating the horrors of our condition; I
desired Sidi-Aly to buy two or three more skins if any could be
found, and I gave him for this purpose some goods which I had
received from the Moors of Timbuctoo. He replied that nobody would
sell them at any price; which I believed, but I suffered too much
not to insist upon making the experiment. He then proposed to send
one of the men belonging to the caravans to the nearest wells which
he said was the best way of getting water to make sangleh to
recruit our exhausted strength. I thought this a good plan, and
agreed to it with pleasure; but Sidi-Aly, who was not the most
scrupulous of Musulmans, never made the least inquiry for such a
person; he took into his own possession what I had given him to pay
the messenger, and sent his son to the well. This he would have
done whether I had paid or not, for as I afterwards found it was
the custom to do so, and I saw the Moors set off from all parts of
the caravan for the same purpose.</p>

<p>My thirst was so intense that I determined, in order to appease
it, to go into the neighbouring tents, and see if I could obtain a
few drops of water out of charity. With my rosary in my hand, I
went from tent to tent, to beg a little water “for the love of
God;” I did not find many charitable souls, but it was not a
favourable moment for the experiment, for we were all suffering
alike. My useless fatigue, and the impatience it occasioned,
augmented my torments, and when I got back to my tent, I fell on
the ground senseless. The Moors who are themselves the most
importunate beggars in the world, do not like to be asked for any
thing. Sidi-Aly told me that I ought not to ask other people for
water, that it was troublesome; I found out also that he boasted
amongst his friends of the kindness he showed me, and said that he
was grieved at the privation I endured. A lying hypocrite! he took
no better care of me for that. Many of the Moors thought that he
had brought me with him out of pure compassion, and, far from
undeceiving them, he took care to confirm them in this error; but
when they questioned me on the subject, I told them the state of
the case, and they then assured me that I had paid too much to my
guide. I knew that full well; but what could I do? only resign
myself to my fate.</p>

<p>About five o’clock in the afternoon, after having quenched our
thirst, we continued our course to the north, and traversed a
district interspersed with grey quartz rocks streaked with white:
at midnight we ascended some sand-hills.</p>

<p>On the 23rd, at ten in the morning, we halted on sandy ground,
but rather more solid than what we had crossed the day before, and
interspersed with rocks of rose-coloured and black granite. Our
situation was still the same; the east wind blew with violence; and
far from affording us any refreshment, it only threatened to bury
us under the mountains of sand which it raised, and what was still
more alarming, our water diminished rapidly from the extreme
drought which it occasioned. Nobody suffered more intensely from
thirst than the poor little slaves, who were crying for water.
Exhausted by their sufferings and their lamentations, these unhappy
creatures fell on the ground, and seemed to have no power to rise;
but the Moors did not suffer them to continue there long when
travelling. Insensible to the sufferings which childhood is so
little fitted to support, these barbarians dragged them along with
violence, beating them incessantly, till they had overtaken the
camels, which were already at a distance.</p>

<p>Indeed, no person was privileged; even the Moors, whose turn it
was to walk by the camels, and who, partly to amuse themselves and
partly to encourage the animals, sang to them as they marched by
their side, were under the same law as those who were riding, and
never tasted water except when it was distributed to the whole
caravan. I thought I could perceive nevertheless that Sidy-Aly had
under his dress a small bottle, like our hunting bottles, and that
the old fox made use of it every now and then in secret to refresh
himself, without any regard for his brethren.</p>

<p>What distressed us most during this horrible day was the pillars
of sand, which threatened every moment to bury us in their course.
One of the largest of these pillars crossed our camp, overset all
the tents, and whirling us about like straws, threw us one upon
another in the utmost confusion; we knew not where we were, and
could distinguish nothing at the distance of a foot. The sand
wrapped us in darkness like a thick fog, and heaven and earth
seemed confounded and blended into one.</p>

<p>In this commotion of nature, the consternation was general;
nothing was heard on all sides but lamentation, and most of my
companions recommended themselves to heaven, crying out with all
their might, “There is no God but God, and Mahomet is his prophet!”
Through these shouts and prayers, and the roaring of the wind, I
could distinguish at intervals, the low plaintive moan of the
camels, who were as much alarmed as their masters, and more to be
pitied, as they had not tasted food for four days. Whilst this
frightful tempest lasted, we remained stretched on the ground,
motionless, dying of thirst, burned by the heat of the sand, and
buffetted by the wind. We suffered nothing however from the sun,
whose disk, almost concealed by the cloud of sand, appeared dim and
shorn of its beams. We durst not use our water, for fear the wells
should be dry, and I know not what would have become of us if,
about three o’clock, the wind had not abated. As soon as it became
calm, we prepared to set off, and the dokhnou was mixed and
distributed. It is difficult to describe with what impatience we
longed for this moment; to enhance the pleasure which I expected
from my portion, I thrust my head into the vessel, and sucked up
the water in long draughts. When I had drunk, I had an unpleasant
sensation all over me, which was quickly succeeded by fresh
thirst.</p>

<p>About half past four in the afternoon, we left the place where
we had experienced this terrible hurricane, and proceeded on our
way towards the north. The camels walked slowly and with effort,
for they were almost exhausted; the poor beasts looked jaded and
dejected. The sight of this numerous caravan, destitute of water,
and condemned to die of thirst, scattered over the arid land, was
truly dismal. The camels gently shaking their heads, or ruminating,
took their course towards the north, without requiring any
direction. We advanced over a sandy soil covered with rocks, rising
about five feet above its surface. Wrapped in my own reflections, I
thought of the wisdom of divine Providence, which has anticipated
all our wants. What a masterpiece of nature’s workmanship, said I,
is the camel! If it were not for this wonderful animal, who could
exist for a week without food, how could these deserts be
traversed? No mortal would dare attempt it, or if any were rash
enough to venture upon such an undertaking, certain death would be
the reward of his temerity. These reflections are trite; but they
were natural in the situation in which I was placed, and I wish to
give an account of my thoughts as well as of my sensations and
sufferings.</p>

<p>On the 24th of May, at nine in the morning, we halted in as
barren a spot as usual. The night had been calm, and the heat
stifling; the fatigue we endured was augmented by the quantity of
sand which fell upon us all the time we were travelling. We
continued all day in a state of impatient expectation mingled with
fear; the Moors, seeing our dejection and sufferings, tried to
encourage us with the hope of the speedy arrival of the messengers
who had been sent in search of water: vain hope! none of them
returned. Despair was general; to keep up our spirits, a small
quantity of water was distributed, and we were told that the delay
of our messengers was not occasioned by their finding no water, but
by their finding it in small quantities, so that it took longer to
fill the skins; that they would have returned immediately if they
had met with no water. Alas! this was a mistake, as will shortly
appear. That we might not lose time in uncertain expectation, we
continued our journey towards the north, at about four o’clock in
the afternoon, over a firmer soil than we had lately crossed, and
equally covered with quartz; we proceeded all night in silence;
nobody slept however, for we were all too thirsty. The Moors who
drove the camels were mute, and relieved one another oftener than
usual.</p>

<p>On the 25th, at nine in the morning, we halted in a plain of
hard sand, producing a few herbs, which were speedily devoured by
the camels. This plain was interspersed with hills of coarse red
sand mixed with gravel. We had now only a skin and a half of water
remaining for eleven persons, we had indeed more than that number
with us, and the allowance was every time more and more scanty; we
suffered beyond all expression. After drinking a few drops, we lay
down to wait for those who were gone in search of a fresh supply.
About ten in the morning the poor wretches arrived half dead with
thirst, and as soon as they had been relieved, as far as our small
store permitted, they told us that they had had great difficulty at
first in finding the well; and that when they had reached it they
were dreadfully disappointed to find it quite dry; they were by
this time so tortured with thirst, that they resolved to kill a
camel, that they might divide amongst them the water contained in
its stomach! a poor resource, for the water was not pure, and there
was very little of it. The blood of the animal would have been a
great refreshment, but they durst not drink it for fear of
infringing the laws of the Koran.</p>

<p>About four in the afternoon, after having drunk the rest of our
water, we were again on our way, more thirsty than ever, and
proceeding slowly towards the north, in the hope of reaching the
wells of Telig by the morning of the 26th. At nine in the evening
we stopped for prayer as usual; a Moor who accompanied us gave us
each a little water, which we received most gratefully; it relieved
us very much. The night was very hot like the preceding. About ten
we turned for three miles to the east, along the foot of some high
hills of moving sand.</p>

<p>On the 26th, at five in the morning, we passed near some large
masses of white earth, which looked at a distance like houses in
ruins; in this part is found a very fine grey sand. The camels,
though laden, lay down to roll themselves, which raised a terrible
dust; and the Moors had infinite difficulty in preventing them from
doing so. I also observed in this place gravel of the same colour,
and further on I found veins of white earth, of the same nature as
the masses already mentioned. About three miles to the west we saw
some sand-hills, covered with granite, the colour of wine-lees; it
is very brittle, and appears to lie in strata three or four feet
thick.</p>

<p>We travelled the whole morning in an extensive plain, enclosed
by these hills; the soil was very hard, covered with rocks and red
and black granite, in flaky strata like slate. About eight in the
morning, after climbing a high hill, we descended into a sort of
basin formed by hills of red granite; the chain extends from east
to west; the highest point that we passed over was three or four
hundred feet high. In this valley, the soil of which is composed of
coarse yellow sand, are the wells of Telig. We found these much
wished-for wells filled with sand; which the Moors immediately fell
to work to clear out; the poor camels which had already become
unmanageable, from knowing that they were near water, were then
permitted to drink: when they were driven away by the whip, they
ran off to a little distance, and came crowding again round the
well, ruminating, and laying their heads on the damp sand which had
been thrown out of it. The first water we drew up was very black
and muddy; but, in spite of the sand which it contained, the camels
fought for it with fury. These wells, which afford plenty of
brackish water, are not more than three or four feet deep.</p>

<p>When the water was fit to drink, I went and thrust my head in
amongst the camels to drink with them; a Moor permitted me to drink
out of his leather bucket, for we had not stopped to unpack
calabashes, which were our usual drinking vessels. To the east of
these wells, where the ground is lowest, we saw the ruins of some
houses built of bricks of white clay; they are almost buried in the
sand which the wind drives over them: further on in the same
direction, there is a great deal of white-veined earth like that
with which these houses were constructed; it bears some resemblance
to lime.</p>

<p>The whole day was employed in watering the camels, who seemed as
if they would never be satisfied, and quarrelled for the last drop
in the trough. I was forced to remain in the sun, for the Moors
were so busy with their camels, that they never thought of pitching
a tent. The east wind, which blew violently, rendered the day very
unpleasant, particularly by the clouds of dust which it threw over
us. As water was now abundant, we had a little rice cooked, which
we ate with butter; it was the first meal we had taken since the
evening of the 19th.</p>

<p>On the 27th, many of our companions went to Toudeyni, which, as
far as I could learn from our travellers, is a little less than
half a day’s journey to the west of the wells of Telig. From this
little town is procured the salt which is brought from Timbuctoo to
Jenné, and thence dispersed through all the Soudan. The salt mines,
as I was informed, are three feet and a half or four feet below the
surface of the ground; the salt is in thick strata, and is brought
out in blocks, after which it is split into cakes of the size I
have already described. These mines are the wealth of the country;
they are worked by negro slaves, superintended by Moors, who live
entirely upon rice and millet, brought from Timbuctoo, and cooked
with camels’ flesh dried in the sun. The water which they drink
filters through the salt, and is extremely brackish; to render it
more palatable they put dokhnou and honey into it; and they also
improve this detestable beverage by mixing with it a sort of cheese
reduced to powder, which I have mentioned above, and which is
nothing but curd dried in the sun.</p>

<p>On the 27th, about three in the evening, after having filled our
skins with water, we broke up our camp, and journeyed to the N. W.
hoping we might meet with some vegetation for the poor camels,
which wanted food the more, for having quenched their thirst. About
five in the afternoon, we halted on a tract of loose sand, of a
grey colour, where we found a few scattered patches of grass, which
the camels devoured with eagerness, harsh as it was, as they had
not eaten scarcely any thing for a week.</p>

<p>Just before we left the wells of Telig, we had been forced to
kill two of these animals, which could go no further, and were
dying of fatigue; the flesh was distributed among all who wished
for it, and we had some for our supper. Part of it was boiled, and
the rice which was cooked with it contracted the odious taste of
the camels’ flesh, which I disliked extremely. The Moors ate this
meat with the greatest avidity, and said that it was excellent, but
I was not at all of their opinion, for I thought it very tough, and
the little I ate disagreed with me; this might however be owing in
part to the brackish water I had drunk. This was nevertheless one
of the most comfortable nights I had passed since I had been in the
desert; I lay down by a patch of grass, and the heat seemed to me
less overwhelming than on the preceding days, which I ascribed to
the vicinity of the wells.</p>

<p>The soil was covered with grey quartz, striped with a dirty
white, mixed with which were several kinds of small gravel.</p>

<p>On the 28th at sun-rise, we were on our way in a northwesterly
direction amongst quartz rocks; here and there upon the ruins of
sand grew a few withered herbs which the camels browsed as they
passed. About ten we crossed a soil covered with small black
gravel, and varied by sandhills extending from east to west; this
sand was harder and yellower than what we had seen the day before;
in some places we found grey gravel and several rocks of black and
grey granite. At half past ten we halted to rest our camels, which
were all very weary, and they were fortunate enough to find a few
thorny plants<a id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class=
"fnanchor">[18]</a> which they amused themselves with cropping.
These plants have short and flexible leaves; the thorn is short but
very hard; by the wise providence of Nature this plant, the only
resource of the animals of the desert, has the property of
remaining green all the year round, in spite of the burning east
winds which so frequently prevail; the camels though not very
delicate would refuse the dry leaves. This plant is very tenacious
of life, throws out long roots on the surface of the ground, and
does not grow to the height of more than eighteen inches; it is
found in sandy places, and I have generally observed that it is
most abundant on the west side of the hills. The roots are thick
and serve for fuel; the Moors use it to cook their provisions, and
at sun-set the slaves went to collect it, to boil our scanty
portion of rice with water and salt, to which they added melted
butter for sauce; this was our frugal supper. My portion was set
apart for me in a little calabash: for the Moors did not chuse to
eat with me after they had discovered that I had had the scurvy;
they held me in utter abhorrence. In spite of the pains which I
took to study their habits and customs, they observed that I could
never eat rice as they did, making it into a little ball in the
hand and tossing it into the mouth; when they meant to insult me,
therefore, they always told me that I ate like a christian.</p>

<p>Sidi-Aly, my guide, was a short man, about four feet high, with
a wrinkled face, black mischievous-looking eyes, a little grey
beard, a rather long chin, and a large mouth, which rendered him
still more hideous: this man ate by himself that he might appear to
be a person of importance. Thrusting his dirty hands, the chapped
skin of which resembled a crocodile’s scales, into a leather
bottle, to take out some butter to put into our rice, he stirred
our victuals about in this cleanly manner. Notwithstanding all the
fine promises of protection which he had made me at first, I soon
found how little he was to be trusted. He refused me the
necessaries of life, and especially water, although he had been
handsomely paid beforehand; the slaves were better off, for he did
not prevent them from helping themselves when they wished—thanks to
the wells at Telig however, there was no longer a scarcity.
Fortunately the heat did not appear to me so great, nor was my
thirst so tormenting as heretofore; whether because we were in the
neighbourhood of water, or because we were now advancing to the
north, I know not; whatever was the cause, I enjoyed some
alleviation of my sufferings: a mortification, however, but of a
different nature was in store for me.</p>

<p>The Moors of Aly’s party, seeing that he had ceased to behave
respectfully to me, were no longer under any restraint; they gave
me ridiculous nicknames, calling me Gageba, from the name of the
camel I rode on, and I was constantly exposed to their insult and
raillery. Encouraged by my silence and patience, they set their
slaves to follow their example, and the slaves were delighted to
torment me; they talked on no other subject; they were continually
ridiculing the form of my face; and they carried their ill-nature
so far as to throw stones at me when I turned my back. All this
persecution was at the instigation of their masters, who often
supplied them with branches of thorns to thrust into my face; at
other times they took little pieces of wood, and proposed that the
slaves should drive them through my nose, as they do to the camels.
These slaves, encouraged by the visible satisfaction of their
masters, collected around me, laughing violently, capering,
dancing, and showing me first the branch of thorns and then the
piece of wood which they had been ordered to run through my nose.
In this way I was tormented all the way from Telig to Tafilet. The
Moors would often say with contempt, “Look at this slave; I would
rather have him than thee, so thou mayst think how little I value
thee.” This insolence was accompanied by immoderate laughter. When
I was eating, these boors would come about me opening their mouths
as wide as they could; then, with hideous grimaces they thrust
their fingers into them to mimic me, and called out at last: “He is
like a christian!”</p>

<p>I swallowed my vexation, trembling at the thought of what such
men would do to me, if they discovered my real sentiments; they
would have made a martyr of me; and I could not but think of the
tortures which poor Major Laing must have suffered from beings who
were still more ferocious. How I longed for the moment when I
should reach Tafilet, and get rid of my tormentors. I had
absolutely nothing left but the clothes I had on, and a new
coussabe which I owed to the generosity of my Timbuctoo host,
besides a padlock which secured the bag that contained my notes:
not a day passed that these did not excite the cupidity of my
companions; when I asked for water they said: “Give us thy new
dress and thy padlock, and thou shalt have something to drink.”
They purposely left me in want that I might give them what they
wished; but I had courage to resist and they obtained nothing.</p>

<p>The wells were now nearer together, and as we came to them more
frequently, we could travel part of the day. When the heat was
excessive, during the journey, those who wanted to drink were
allowed to have water; on these occasions they pointed at me and
said to one another: “Do not let us give <i>him</i> any, till he
has promised us something.” I disdained to have recourse to
entreaty, and bore both hunger and thirst rather than ask for any
thing at their hands; so I turned my head away, and pretended not
to hear what they said. Thirst at last compelled me to apply to
Sidi-Aly, who muttered when he ordered them to give me water; while
I was drinking it he imitated the humming noise made to induce the
camels to drink. He durst not refuse me the water for his own sake;
for the other Moors in the caravan, who were not his associates,
would have been indignant; in their presence he always pretended
great kindness for me, and compassion for the sufferings which I
had endured in the desert. It was impossible that he could
altogether deceive them, for, notwithstanding the abundance of
water which we had since we left Telig, I was often obliged to
apply to the other Moors in the caravan when I wanted drink: I was
also driven out of our tent many times by the rudeness of my
tormentors, and took shelter with my neighbours, who were much
amused with my conversation, and collected around me, to question
me about my escape from the christians, their manners and customs;
they asked me also whether I had been ill-treated by my white
master. I always took care, as much as I could, to counteract the
impression which they all have, that Musulmans are ill-treated
amongst us, an idea which proceeds from their intolerant
system.</p>

<p>They all showed me their guns and inquired where they were made;
and when I told them that they came from France, I observed that
they thought them the more valuable: accordingly, if I wanted to
flatter a Moor I told him that his gun was of French manufacture,
and out of gratitude for the pleasure which I afforded him, he
commonly offered me a share of his dokhnou and water.</p>

<p>On the 29th, at six in the morning, we proceeded northward. The
soil over which we passed was covered with quartz. About nine
o’clock in the morning, we halted in a place where we found some
traces of vegetation amidst the rocks. One of the Moors took water
in his leather bag, and went to tend the camels; the others were
engaged in examining and weighing their gold; they commonly hide it
as I have already mentioned, in pieces of rag, on which they put a
mark denoting the quantity, and the person to whom it belongs; for
this gold is often the proceeds of goods entrusted to them by
merchants, when they leave Tafilet.</p>

<p>The camel upon which I rode was laden with ostrich-feathers
only. That it might be the less fatigued with the journey, I was
never allowed to mount it while it was on its knees; one of the
Moors was commissioned by Sidi-Aly to help me to mount; and, for
the reasons above stated, this Moor was very ill-natured, and took
every opportunity of playing me a trick which might raise a laugh
amongst his companions at my expense. At nightfall, rice was cooked
for our supper. We had nothing before that but a little dokhnou and
water to refresh us; as the roots of this plant were scarce, the
slaves were sent to pick up camel’s dung for fuel; though the wind
quickly effaces their footsteps, it is always easy to track them by
the great quantity of their excrement.</p>

<p>At ten in the evening, we broke up, and proceeded towards the N.
W. The soil, which was as unvaried as ever, was covered on the
surface by quartz. The night was calm, and the heat stifling.</p>

<p>On the 30th of May, we halted at eleven in the morning, and
found some herbage, which supplied the camels with food during that
day and part of the succeeding night.</p>

<p>On the 31st, at two in the morning, we continued our journey in
the same direction. The soil was sandy, and covered with hills of
loose yellow sand. In crossing the desert, I perceived, at a
distance, immense tracts, which had the appearance of rivers or
lakes, with islands of sand rising in the midst of them; they
presented themselves to the eye, in the horizon of the desert, as
places where one might quench one’s thirst. This prospect broke for
a time the uniformity of these vast deserts; on approaching, I was
cruelly disappointed, for the water vanished, and I saw nothing but
loose sand where I had hoped to quench my thirst. This illusion
only rendered my situation more dreadful, when I was consumed with
thirst, and saw the sea receding before me as by enchantment. It is
impossible to form any correct idea of a <i>mirage</i> without
having seen one.</p>

<p>Towards noon we halted; the burning heat was augmented by a
scorching wind from the east. My thirst was excessive, but I had no
means of quenching it; my companions told me, to comfort me, that
we should soon come to wells. In fact, the wells of Cramès are in
this part of the desert; and we hoped to find water there; but
alas! they were dry. These wells are situated near a chain of hills
extending from N. N. W. towards south. At intervals, we came to a
few tufts of herbage; the only trace of vegetation which is to be
found here.</p>

<p>We pitched our tents, and sheltered ourselves under them from
the burning wind; we had a very short allowance of water dealt out
to us, on account of the impossibility of procuring more. The soil
in this part is composed of hard sand, mingled with gravel; the
east wind blew with such violence, that all our tents were
overturned. About sunset, we had an alarm; the camel-drivers at a
distance from the camp, saw some Moors, whom they took for
banditti; they came to us, calling out, “To arms! to arms!” The
whole camp was immediately on the alert; every one flew to arms,
and hastened to meet the supposed enemy. I saw some of our party
tremble, which made me presume that the danger was great. No person
was left in the camp besides three or four old marabouts, the
slaves and myself; they fell forthwith to prayers, and gave me a
little water and a piece of camel’s flesh, I suppose to propitiate
Heaven. For my part, I was not less uneasy than the Moors; I
speculated sorrowfully upon what would be our lot, if we lost our
camels, our only resource in the desert. We shall die in this
horrid country, thought I, for we are too distant to receive help
from any quarter; and as a climax to misfortunes, our provision of
water is exhausted. In fact, a few of the camels had returned, but
the greater number were grazing out of the camp. In the course of
an hour, I beheld, to my great satisfaction, our intrepid warriors
returning; and they informed us, with an air of triumph, that the
robbers had disappeared. All the evening the camp was in a tumult;
and there was a long deliberation what was to be done for want of
water. It was an object to set off at night to avoid the heat of
the day; but our prudent companions were afraid of being attacked
on their way; it was even suggested, that the robbers might have
taken possession of the wells, at which we were to arrive the next
day. Sentinels were appointed, and a watch was kept for a mile
round the camp.</p>

<p>On the 1st of June, at five in the morning, we prepared to
continue our course to the north. Our water-bags were now dry, for
we had supplied our last night’s sentinels with water. All the
forenoon we were travelling over a barren soil, which was dreary to
look at; it was composed of very hard sand, covered with much grey
gravel, and small, flat, sharp-edged, black stones. I perceived,
which was rather unusual, a number of small tracks of former
caravans, and which the winds had not had the power to efface,
because the soil is hard and stony.</p>

<p>I shall here relate a conversation which passed in my presence
between Sidi-Molut, a Trajacant Moor, and Sidi-Body, associates of
Sidi-Aly, my guide, and some of my greatest tormentors; the
conversation turned upon the number of slaves they supposed the
Europeans to possess— just as they suppose that all the christians,
of whom they know nothing but the names, are of one nation and
subject to one chief. In this persuasion, Sidi-Molut related that
the sultan of Morocco had made an agreement with the sultan of the
christians for the exchange of prisoners of both sexes; and that,
by this treaty, a christian was to be exchanged for ten Musulmans,
or a thousand piastres. The moment Body heard that the price of a
christian slave was fixed at this sum, he interrupted Sidi-Molut,
and said: “Well, we must sell Sidi-Abdallahi,” pointing at me with
his finger. The other replied that I was not a christian but a
Musulman, and that a Musulman was worth all the gold in the world.
I could not refrain from darting a look of contempt at Body; and I
even told him I saw plainly, that if he could he would sell me, the
sooner the better, without any respect for his religion. He did not
seem to pay attention to what I said; but Molut looked at me with a
smile and said: “Body is a rogue, is not he Abdallahi?”</p>

<p>The soil over which we travelled in the afternoon was covered
with hills of loose yellow sand; we saw some vegetables, but at
long intervals; the heat was excessive, and again increased the
pangs of thirst. At last, about two in the afternoon, we halted
near the wells of Trasas or Trarzas, situated in a plain surrounded
by hills of yellow sand. These wells, which are numerous, are seven
or eight feet deep; the water is salt and most disagreeable.</p>

<p>Here we found some Trajacant Moors, the very people whom we had
descried the day before, and who had alarmed us so much; we had
occasioned them equal alarm, and it was for this reason that they
had not halted at the wells of Cramès. The wells of Trasas were
filled with sand, but the Trajacants had cleared out two of them.
In this plain, the surface of which is composed of hard grey sand,
we found some lumps of salt, and near the place where we watered
our beasts, several houses built with bricks of this substance. The
Moors informed me, that there was formerly a large village in this
place, belonging to their tribe, and that the inhabitants used to
work the Trasa salt mines, and carried on considerable commerce in
this article with the Soudan. They had many camels, as I learnt
from the same authority; but the village had been destroyed by the
Tafilet Moors. It is, nevertheless, very probable, that this
village was voluntarily abandoned by the inhabitants, who might be
discouraged by the great difficulty of finding fodder for their
beasts, and grain for themselves, and also by the annoyance of
being always forced to drink salt water.</p>

<p>As the Trajacants had taken the trouble to clear the wells, we
had nothing to do but to profit by their labour; and to reward
them, Sidi-Aly and Sidi-Molut joined to give them a good
supper.</p>

<p>As our tent was not pitched, I took shelter under that of the
Trajacants. I found them drinking dokhnou, and talking over the
adventures of their journey; the moment they saw me, they perceived
that I was not an African; their first look announced their
ill-will, and one of them asked me who I was. A Moor of our caravan
who happened to be with me, spared me the trouble of answering; he
took the affair into his own hands, and related, without any
omission, the fiction which I had industriously circulated, and
which was now received as truth amongst all those who knew me. They
afterwards criticised my countenance, which did not seem to them to
possess the genuine Arab character, though I was by this time
exceedingly dark; but my complaint had entirely disfigured me. The
Trajacants asked me many questions about the christians, and made
me repeat a verse of the Koran which I had learnt by heart; they
afterwards drank by turns, and then poured salt water upon what was
left in the vessel, and asked me to drink.</p>

<p>On the 2d in the morning, Aly sent two of his Moors to look out
for fodder; they went a great distance, and returned in the evening
with two little bundles of straw, which were given to the animals,
and immediately devoured. Sidi-Aly asked me to go to seek food for
my camel; I replied that he might go himself, and I went to the
tent of two Wadnoun marabouts. These men were very kind, and
censured Sidi-Aly’s conduct towards me without reserve. All this
day was employed in watering the beasts, and in laying in a stock
of water for ourselves. The salt water penetrated our skins and ran
out at the seams, in spite of all we could do. Some of the
Trajacants set off before us.</p>

<p>On the 3rd, at five in the morning, we proceeded to the N. W.
first crossing a chain of hills, and then travelling over a soil
composed of black gravel, with flat, sharp-edged stones. We halted
about half past eleven in a plain, in which were a few thorny
plants for the camels to feed on. As we had plenty of water, we
boiled a little rice with some morsels of camel’s flesh, which had
been dried in the sun, and were as hard as leather. After this
savoury repast, we lay down on the ground by our baggage, to
rest.</p>

<p>On the 4th, at two in the morning, we prepared for departure,
and directed our course N. N. W. till towards eleven; we travelled
at first over very hard sand, and then crossed a chain of hills
stretching from E. to W. About two in the afternoon, we halted,
very much fatigued, because we had had to ascend the hills of loose
sand amongst which we had encamped over night. I have observed that
fodder is more abundant in these hilly tracts than it is elsewhere.
I looked in vain for shells on these mountains; a search which was
suggested by the idea that the sea may formerly have covered the
site of these immense deserts.</p>

<p>On the 5th of June, at three o’clock in the morning, we
continued to ascend lofty downs of loose sand; our direction was
northerly: the western side of these downs was covered with thorny
plants, which served the camels for food. The poor animals moved
with so much difficulty, that our progress was slow and painful; we
advanced but a mile an hour.</p>

<p>Towards noon, having climbed to a great elevation, we found
ourselves on an extensive plain of very hard grey sand: we halted
near the wells of Amoul-Gragim; which, like the preceding, were
filled up; these are only seven or eight feet deep; their water is
muddy and salt, but less disagreeable to the taste than that of
Trasas.</p>

<p>This night seemed cooler than those which had preceded it: my
rest was disturbed by the appearance of a serpent, which suddenly
awoke me, and had nearly reached my head when I perceived it. I
rose in haste; the reptile was alarmed by the noise I made, and
returned immediately to its hole, which was not far distant: this
serpent was five feet and a half long, and as thick as the thigh of
a boy twelve years old. The idea of so unpleasant a neighbour
banished sleep for the remainder of the night: my travelling
companions also experienced similar visits, and appeared no less
dismayed by them than myself.</p>

<p>The whole of the 6th was employed in watering our camels; we
procured for them stalks of <i>hedysarum-alhagi</i>, and branches
of the tamarisk, which grows on the plain at some distance from the
wells: these were quickly devoured. This night we lay down as on
the preceding, and I was again annoyed with the sight of enormous
serpents.</p>

<p>At four o’clock in the morning of the 7th, we directed our
course to the N. N. E., among the chain of sand-hills called Helk;
but these are not by much so high as those we had crossed the day
before. Sidi-Aly, whom I questioned on the subject, and who at
times vouchsafed an answer, assured me that in none of his former
travels in the Soudan had he seen such lofty sand-hills; his route
had always been more northerly.</p>

<p>As our road was better than that of the preceding day, we
travelled at least two miles an hour. About half past eleven we
halted at the foot of the chain, on a somewhat hilly plain of grey
gravel, the finest I had yet seen.</p>

<p>On the 8th, we set out at four in the morning, taking a
northerly direction, over a sandy and tolerably level soil. Near
noon we halted in a plain of firm ground, covered with sharp flints
as flat as slate, and mixed with small gravel; this plain is
surrounded by gently swelling downs. I longed to emerge from these
frightful deserts, where the only indications of animated nature
were the distressing east wind, and some light-footed antelopes,
which swept across them with the rapidity of an arrow. I saw in
several places skeletons of these animals, dried up by the burning
sun; they had undoubtedly died of thirst.</p>

<p>On the 9th, at about one in the morning, we pursued our journey
northwards; the soil was covered with black gravel, and studded
with pointed rocks of the same colour. A little before eleven we
halted at the wells of Amoul-Taf, situated among rocks of grey
granite; it was necessary to open them; they are only four feet
deep, the water sweet, but not plentiful; tamarisks flourish in the
neighbourhood. We surrounded these wells with straw to prevent the
sand from falling in.</p>

<p>The camels were but half watered, and we filled our leathern
bags in preparation for departure.</p>

<p>At four o’clock in the morning of the 10th, we continued our
progress northward; and climbed a steep hill of granite with much
difficulty, finding no beaten track. The soil we traversed was
broken by hillocks of black gravel, and by sharp rocks: the country
offered not the smallest sign of vegetation. Towards nine in the
morning we descended into a plain, where we found a little grass,
and some very stunted <i>mimosa ferruginea</i>.</p>

<p>Here we rested to let our camels graze, and killed one, which,
quite overcome with the heat, could carry the baggage no longer:
its flesh was distributed amongst the people of the caravan, and
made us a very indifferent supper, but for want of better we were
obliged to eat it.</p>

<p>On the 11th we proceeded at four in the morning. If my
inclinations had been consulted, the journey would have been
delayed till sunrise, for I was much fatigued by rising every day
so early. I was so sleepy that it was with much difficulty I could
keep my seat upon my camel. I frequently called to mind that the
only chance of surviving the journey lay in hastening our march;
this idea supported my courage, and restored my exhausted strength:
I confess nevertheless, that I envied the fate of those who can
purchase fame at a cheaper rate than by such painful trials and
continually recurring dangers.</p>

<p>We still travelled northward over a dry soil resembling that
which we had traversed on the preceding day. As we advanced in this
direction, the heat gradually diminished, and our thirst became
less intolerable. About ten o’clock we halted; the tent was
pitched, and I lay down in the hope of obtaining a little rest:
next to thirst, the greatest torment I suffered arose from the
fatiguing necessity of rising at all hours of the night, to pursue
our journey.</p>

<p>On the 12th, at two in the morning, still half asleep, I mounted
my camel and we resumed our route northward, over a level, hard and
stony soil: I saw some mimosas scattered in the plain at great
distances apart, without any other sign of vegetation. About nine,
we descended, through a very narrow path, into a deep ravine,
surrounded by enormous blocks of granite, of a pink and various
other colours, in strata of eighteen or twenty inches thick. The
camels, fatigued with so bad a road, had much difficulty in
descending amongst these rocks. It was ten <span class="sc2">A.
M.</span>, when we halted at the wells of el-Ekseif, situated at
the very bottom of the ravine. These wells, or springs, are shaded
by a pretty grove of palm-trees of beautiful appearance; such at
least is the impression produced by the contrast of this umbrageous
and refreshing spot with the desolation that reigns around, and
with the bare and arid region which we had just crossed; a few
reeds and some rushes also grow round about.</p>

<p>This verdure, embosomed among immense rocks of granite, on a
spot where, as far as the eye can reach, no other trace of
vegetation is perceptible, has something at the same time wild and
pleasing, which produces an effect strikingly picturesque.</p>

<p>The water of the wells of el-Ekseif is very good; I found a real
luxury in drinking it, for it was sweet, bright, and limpid.</p>

<p>Tired of eating nothing but boiled rice, I went to a Moor who
treated me with better fare. I recounted to him my privations, in
which he seemed to take some interest, exhorting me to bear my
misfortunes with patience, and inviting me to partake of his
supper, which consisted of rice, boiled with meat dried in the sun,
and seasoned with allspice; the meat he had brought from Jenné, in
which town he had lived several years occupied in commerce, I
thought, by making him a little present, to obtain in return
frequent invitations to his meals, and therefore gave him a piece
of twenty <i>sous</i>, which he accepted; he considered himself
however under no engagement in my favour, for he invited me no
more.</p>

<p>On the 13th of June, we remained beside the wells to recover
from our fatigues, and refresh ourselves with copious draughts of
the delicious water. The soil on which we were encamped was dry,
and full of stones, which we were obliged to clear away from the
spot where the camels were to lie, lest they should be hurt. In the
evening water was so abundant here that I was enabled to cool my
body with a calabash of cold water, and I found great benefit from
it.</p>

<p>On the 14th, we set out at five in the morning, still pursuing
the same course. Descending into a plain where we found a little
herbage, we halted about nine o’clock to allow the camels to graze.
The road had been difficult and we had travelled about two miles an
hour. At five in the evening, judging that the camels were
satisfied, we continued our journey northwards, but had scarcely
proceeded a mile when we were obliged to wait for part of our
company, who had stayed behind; the ground which we were upon was
composed of very hard grey sand, covered with fine white gravel.
Towards eleven at night, the stragglers, whom their beasts had
carried to a distance in pursuit of food, arrived, and we resumed
our route, guided by the pole-star; we travelled all night and till
eleven in the morning of the 15th.</p>

<p>On the 15th, we met with the same soil as the day before,
without any vegetation. A strong north wind prevailed and greatly
incommoded us. At half past five <span class="sc2">P. M.</span>,
after drinking some <i>dokhnou</i>, we again entered upon the
desert. Travelling northwards all night, we found the air unusually
cold, but free from fog.</p>

<p>On the 16th of June, at sunrise, we saw a little chain of hills
stretching from north to south; they appeared black, which made me
presume that they were granite.</p>

<p>About ten in the morning, we rested at the foot of a chain of
hills of loose sand, which ran in a parallel direction with the
granite hills.</p>

<p>At two in the morning of the 17th, we broke up our camp, and
proceeded northwards; having on either side of the road hills of
very fine sand. The poor camels cropped as they went along the
heads of some prickly plants, the only species of vegetable which
they could find. About ten we halted at the wells called Marabouty,
situated a quarter of a mile east of our route, amongst high hills
of moving sand: these wells, which are no deeper than the last,
were also filled up, but we soon opened them.</p>

<p>I eagerly pressed forward to ask for drink, for I had not been
able to obtain any on the road: my thirst was intense, and
augmented by a violent westerly wind, which drifted the sand and
rendered the journey most fatiguing. The neighbourhood of the wells
is covered with the excrements of camels, to such a degree, that if
the Moors were not well acquainted with their situation, these
traces would suffice to point them out: the water is very good.</p>

<p>Another camel at the point of death was killed here and some of
its flesh boiled for eating. Sidi-Aly had some pieces dried, and
sprinkled with salt, to preserve them as a luxury for himself
during the remainder of the journey.</p>

<p>On the 18th, at seven in the morning, we proceeded N. N. E. at
first amongst the sand-hills afterwards, over a plain of black
gravel. About ten we halted to feed the camels, and a meal was
prepared with part of the animal killed the day before. This mess
did not provoke the appetite, but necessity taught us to eat it.
One particular that I think worthy of remark is that my health
continued perfectly good in the desert, notwithstanding the
privations of every kind which I experienced. I had no fear of
perishing but by thirst; and this was increased by the apprehension
that we might lose our way and wander to a distance from the wells.
Providence, however, watched for my preservation, and I escaped
even this peril, the greatest, perhaps, which these frightful
solitudes present.</p>

<p>At one o’clock in the morning of the 19th, we resumed our route
over a hard soil covered with gravel, and followed the same course;
some hills of little elevation were scattered over the country. At
noon we arrived at a spot which offered a little grass, and there
halted. A man was deputed to take care of the cattle, and we
assembled under the tent for refreshment, and to shelter ourselves
from the wind which now blew up clouds of dust.</p>

<p>On the 20th, at one in the morning, we resumed our journey
northwards, over loose sand, and halted at ten; our camels found
some prickly shrubs scattered over the plain. Towards midnight we
broke up, and again travelled towards the north over some hillocks
which rendered our progress slow and painful.</p>

<p>On the 21st, at nine <span class="sc2">A. M.</span> we halted in
the midst of sand-hills, amongst which grass grew pretty
plentifully. We were a mile west of the wells of el-Guedea, where
we found tolerably good water: the heat was greater than on the
preceding days and it was increased by a dead calm: we were this
day fully occupied in laying in a stock of water.</p>

<p>On the 22nd we recommenced our journey, still proceeding
northwards; our progress was slow, as the camels browzed by the way
on some thorny and half dried plants. The soil was of the same
nature as that we had last traversed. At ten in the morning we
halted to avoid the heat of the day, and about ten at night broke
up our camp, directing our course northward amongst sandy hills
till day-light, when we came to a more level soil covered with
white gravel.</p>

<p>On the 23rd, at nine in the morning, we suspended our progress.
Some pieces of camel’s flesh dried in the sun were boiled for our
dinner, but proved as hard as wood. The same evening at nine, we
broke up, and, after proceeding northward for three hours, turned
to the N. N. W. over a level soil, without any vegetation, and
overspread with small gravel.</p>

<p>On the 24th, at eleven in the morning, the heat being
insufferable, we halted under our tent till it moderated, drinking
a little dokhnou; and, about four in the afternoon, after having
eaten some rice boiled with the flesh of the camel, we again
advanced, bearing N. N. W. till sunset, when we turned northward to
cross a chain of low sand-hills on which some grass grows. I learnt
from my comrades that the Moors of el-Harib come as far as this
place in the rainy seasons to pasture their flocks. We continued
our journey till two in the morning, over a hard gravelly soil and
some hills of loose sand; after which we halted till dawn, lying
down beside our camels to rest. On each side of the place where we
stopped were great rocks of granite, amongst which were seen some
miserable plants of <i>mimosa ferruginea</i>.</p>

<p>On the 25th, at four in the morning, there being sufficient
light, we slowly advanced amidst large blocks of quartz, among
which I saw many thorny plants and stunted mimosas, the bare
branches of which the famished camels cropped and ate with avidity.
Whether these animals were sensible that they were approaching
their own country and the moment when their wants would be
satisfied, I know not, but they appeared more sprightly and
vigorous than usual. About ten o’clock the same morning, we halted
at the wells of Mayara, situated in a defile surrounded by granite
and some mimosas. The water of these wells, which are only four or
five feet deep, is salt; its taste is detestable: we had still one
leather bottle full of good water, but the Moors would not allow me
my share of it; they kept it all to themselves, and told me to go
and drink with the camels. Three Moorish slaves, who were of our
party, were more fortunate than I was; a small portion of the good
water was given to them. At a hundred and fifty feet from the salt
wells, there is another, the water of which is fit to drink, but it
was nearly dry; several Moors passed part of the day in emptying
it, and towards sunset I could quench my thirst at my ease.</p>

<p>On the 26th, I was awakened at one in the morning: we proceeded
N. N. E. between two hills sixty or seventy fathoms in height,
composed of great blocks of grey quartz and some granites of the
same colour: many mimosas and <i>hedysarum alhagi</i> grow in this
defile, the soil of which consists of grey sand. So long was it
since I had seen any thing similar in point of vegetation, that I
thought myself in the most beautiful country in the world.</p>

<p>About eight in the morning, we entered a plain of black sand, in
which we perceived here and there spots resembling little islands
covered with herbage and mimosas. In proportion as we approached
the limits of the desert, nature appeared less desolate. At eleven,
we halted upon loose sand: we experienced the whole day a stifling
heat, which created a dreadful thirst; as night drew on, some rice
was boiled as usual for supper. About ten o’clock on the same day,
we started towards the N. N. E., over a soil broken by deep
ravines, on the edge of which some vegetation appeared. Our
progress was slow, for the camels were allowed to graze as they
went on; we proceeded but two miles an hour.</p>

<p>At nine in the morning of the 27th, we stopped by the wells of
Sibicia, situated between blocks of pale rose-coloured granite, and
surrounded by a pleasant grove of date-trees, the verdure of which
presented an agreeable contrast with the rest of the soil. The
water of these wells, which are only seven or eight feet deep, is
clear and delicious to drink.</p>

<p>About six in the evening, being occupied in prayer, we heard a
musket-shot at a distance; this noise did not surprise us, as we
knew that Sidi-Aly had gone on before from el-Guedea, to fix upon a
spot where his camp might be pitched, and we expected that he would
send some one to meet us and conduct us thither. Several Moors ran
immediately towards the point whence the sound proceeded: it was
actually a Moor sent to us by Sidi-Aly, who informed us that in two
days we should reach the camp of the Moors of el-Harib. He was the
bearer of letters for several members of the caravan, acquainting
them with the state of the country and the prices of merchandise
and provisions; part of the evening was employed in reading them
publicly, so that the whole caravan shared the benefit of the news.
We set out again at ten in the evening, taking a northerly course;
and travelled all night over a gravelly soil.</p>

<p>On the 28th, about seven in the morning, we descended a very
steep hill, bestrewed with rocks of granite, soft and crumbling, in
strata from twelve to eighteen inches thick. The road was very
difficult and even dangerous for the beasts of burden. About ten in
the morning, we pitched our tents in a plain, upon a stony soil,
and surrounded by hills of granite of the most arid appearance.</p>

<p>I was not suffered quietly to enjoy the shelter which this halt
offered us; for the Moors incessantly tormented me. Sidi-Body, the
same who proposed to Sidi-Molut to sell me, carried his indignities
so far as to strike me. I was obliged to take refuge under another
tent, where I lay down for the remainder of the day. The wind blew
with violence; I was very thirsty and could obtain no water from my
companions. The strangers to whom I applied pitied my situation and
gave me a little. I passed the day without eating; in the evening I
was indebted for a handful of rice to the generosity of my new
hosts, who awoke me that I might share their meal.</p>

<p>As we approached the encampment of el-Harib, some Moors prepared
their dress, with the intention of preceding us on the following
day, in order, no doubt, to enjoy as soon as possible the pleasure
of meeting their families. One of them, the son of Sidi-Aly, my
guide, had paid court to me for several days, that I might be
induced to lend him my wrapper, his own being torn: as I had less
reason to complain of him than of his comrades, during the journey,
I consented to lend it to him.</p>

<p>About nine at night, we again decamped and took a north-west
direction, as we had done from seven till ten in the morning.
Toward midnight, we changed our course to N. N. E. through the
passes of high mountains of granite, amongst which were pools of
salt water. Enormous masses of these rocks, suspended over our
heads, seemed to threaten to tumble and crush us. In one of these
defiles, the camel that I rode took fright, turned aside and ran
away. I was thrown flat on my back upon the gravel.</p>

<p>The pain I experienced was so great, that I was persuaded some
of my bones were broken, and indeed that I was near my end. A Moor
came to my assistance; he took me in his arms, and pressed me
violently against his breast, which afforded me some ease. He
assisted me to overtake my camel, which had been stopped, and made
it knee, that I might remount with more ease; this Moor was a
stranger, who did not belong to the company of Aly. My sufferings
were still so acute, that I could not restrain my groans; I
conceived that my skull was fractured; I experienced a giddiness in
my head and could scarcely see. I was not relieved from these
symptoms till the following day, and the pains in my loins
continued with much violence, so that I could not stoop without
great difficulty. I felt the effects of this fall for more than two
months. The Moor who assisted me to rise placed me himself upon my
camel, which I should have been incapable of mounting without
help.</p>

<p>To issue from these defiles, we were obliged to climb a steep
and lofty mountain; the path was narrow and winding, and presented
considerable difficulties, in consequence of which all the company
were required to alight from their camels. I alone continued to
ride; I was so severely bruised that I should have found it
impossible to walk any part of the way. This exposed me to numerous
invectives from some of the Moors, who threatened to throw stones
at me to compel me to dismount: those, however, who had witnessed
my accident took my part, and I was allowed to proceed in
peace.</p>

<p>The camels, exhausted by the fatigues of the journey, advanced
with reluctance, took two or three steps, then stopped, painfully
turning their heads first on one side and then on the other,
uttering low moans, while they seemed to measure with their eyes
the laborious task which still remained to be accomplished. It was
with regret that I found myself obliged to continue mounted, for I
pitied these unfortunate animals. The Moors, walking behind,
encouraged them with their voices, repeating certain words in
different tones, in the way of a song, which the camels appeared to
understand.</p>

<p>The track frequently passed so near the edge of the rock, and
was so narrow, that I thought it impossible to follow it without
being thrown down frightful precipices. At length, having with
great toil attained the summit, we discovered an extensive plain,
the soil of which, composed of gravel and grey sand, is very hard
and interspersed with thin flat stones, resembling slates, and of a
grey and black colour.</p>

<p>On the 29th, about two in the morning, the soil changed,
becoming more sandy, and offering some traces of vegetation. At
daybreak we stopped to perform our devotions; after having returned
thanks to God, those who wished to precede us set out for the camp
upon fresh camels and went off at a swift pace.</p>

<p>We followed them soon afterwards, in a N. N. W. direction, over
a hard soil covered with coarse grey gravel. About eight o’clock,
we descended into a plain in which the vegetation was tolerably
fine; I particularly remarked the tamarisk in considerable
quantity. The herbage, though dry, on account of the season,
afforded abundant nourishment to our camels.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the camp, apprised of our arrival, hastened
out to meet us: the women presented the children to their fathers,
who expressed the greatest joy, embracing them alternately, and
affectionately returning their caresses. I was much struck by this
interesting scene, and could not avoid comparing it in my mind with
the coldness, which amongst the Braknas the wife and children of
Mohammed-Sidi-Moctar had manifested on occasion of his return to
his family.</p>

<p>About nine o’clock in the morning, we arrived at the dwelling of
Sidi-Aly. His camp belonged to the tribe of Body; it was composed
of twelve or fifteen tents, covered with stuff made of camel’s
hair, pitched in a spacious plain, to the north of which rose high
mountains entirely bare and running from east to west. My joy on
finding myself in an inhabited region was extreme; the idea that
henceforth I might quench my thirst at my ease made me forget the
fatigue of the desert.</p>

<p>On entering the camp my guide met me laughing, and asked me to
give him my hand in token of peace: he inquired after my health and
even lodged me in the tent of his aged sister, who was so
prejudiced that she durst not approach me. I had soon numerous
visits from men and women; for Aly had related to his countrymen
the various circumstances which had determined me to cross the
desert on my return to my own country. The women, whom I found much
more curious than the men, teased me incessantly; they talked all
together, so that I was at a loss which to listen to. In order to
attract my attention, one struck me on the shoulder, another on the
head, and another pulled me by my clothes. Sidi-Salah, to whom I
had in the morning lent my wrapper, gave me some dates for my
breakfast; I found them however so hard that I ate but few, which
nevertheless renewed the pains in my jaws.</p>

<p>Aly, my guide, had couscous of wheat prepared for two Mahometan
priests, of the Trajacants who had travelled with us: I expected
that he would have offered me a small share, for I had eaten
nothing throughout the day, except the bad dates which had been
sent to me; but I was disappointed and compelled to wait
patiently.</p>

<p>At sun-set, Aly killed a fine sheep to regale the priests; the
liver and suet were stuck upon skewers, laid upon the coals, and
eaten half-raw. He gave me a taste of it; the children and their
parents divided the entrails, which they also laid upon the
coals.</p>

<p>The remainder of the mutton made a plentiful supper; they gave
me a good portion of couscous of barley-meal, adding a small piece
of the belly of the sheep which had been reserved. Though this
couscous was detestable, both for its want of seasoning and for the
great quantity of fat with which it was made, I ate of it with
appetite.</p>

<p>On the 30th of June, the women were early at work grinding wheat
for the breakfast of the priests. The means by which they obtain
the flour separated from the bran is as follows: they have two
round flat granite stones, placed one upon another, and set into
one another by means of a piece of wood fixed to the centre of the
lower stone; the upper has an opening through which the grain is
introduced; it is then turned with a handle. Two women are employed
in working this machine, although it is neither heavy nor difficult
to move.</p>

<p>When the wheat had been thoroughly sifted several times through
a sieve of thin canvas, the two daughters of Sidi-Aly, as dirty as
their father, proceeded to knead it into a cake without yeast: one
of them made a great fire of tamarisk wood, to heat the ground on
the spot chosen for baking the cake: when it was considered
sufficiently hot, they swept the place and laid the dough upon the
earth; the embers were then replaced upon it and covered with loose
sand which had been heated for the purpose: when half-baked it was
washed, broken in pieces, and thrown into a calabash, full of fat,
the remains of the preceding night’s supper; a kind of sauce was
now poured over it and a piece of a sheep recently killed was
added. All the family and the priests partook of this stew, and
when they had eaten sufficiently they brought me a small portion
which remained, with a little sauce upon it; this formed both my
breakfast and dinner. On the succeeding days they gave me nothing
but dates; I represented to Sidi-Aly that they disagreed with me,
owing to the complaint in my teeth, which prevented my chewing them
without experiencing severe pain. Aly answered that he was sorry
for it, but he had no meat to give me; that in this country dates
only were eaten during the day and couscous at night: the remainder
of the rice which had been given me at el-Arawan, was put into his
tent, and the family ate of it without ever offering me any. At
length, having no remedy, it was necessary to conform to this mode
of living upon dates alone: but how much did I suffer! I had soon a
sore on the roof of my mouth, and fearing lest I should be again
reduced to the dreadful state in which I had formerly been, I gave
up eating these fruits, and determined to beg a little camel’s milk
from our neighbours, whom I found but little affected by my
petition. Aly had several daughters whose young lovers were
frequently coming to his tent; sangleh was often dressed for their
breakfast, but they never once offered me any, though they knew
that it gave me such excruciating pain to eat the dates. In three
days’ time the family of Aly began to persecute me; they conceived
they could not do better than imitate the chief, who, on all
occasions, manifested an implacable hatred to me. The women
appeared to take pleasure in tormenting me; they would not allow me
a tent; the moment I lay down to sleep, they played a hundred
tricks to oblige me to rise, they pricked me with a piece of wood,
dragged me by the legs, took away my wrapper, and threw water over
my face. Tired of these endless annoyances I resolved to take
refuge in the tent of a good blacksmith who had performed the
pilgrimage to Mecca, which was a great recommendation to him in
that country: his aged mother was very pious, and received me
kindly; she gave me for refreshment milk and water, which beverage
they, as well as the Braknas called cheni. The good old woman
thought she was performing a meritorious act, acceptable to God, in
saying that her tent was mine, and that I might come thither to
sleep whenever I pleased. Though a devout Mahometan, she was full
of spirits and fond of a joke, nor did I find her given to
falsehood like the other women. Sidi-Aly, seeing that his people
would not endure me in any of his tents, had one pitched for me
alone, but it was impossible to remain in it, for, as the air
entered at one side only, the heat was suffocating.</p>

<p>Early on the 2nd of July, the sister of Sidi-Aly came to seek
me, holding in her disgusting hands a lump of sangleh covered with
hairs, for she had used the same butter to grease her head and to
season this mess: though I was exceedingly hungry I had not courage
to taste it. This woman, about sixty years of age, took me aside,
and said in a low voice: “Listen, Abdallahi, thou who wert brought
up among the christians, who know every thing except the path to
salvation, thou shouldst be as wise as they are; and I come to pray
thee to make me a charm for one of my nieces who wants a husband;
if thou consentest, and the charm proves good I will provide thee
with sangleh for two days.” She paused a moment to hear my answer;
she then added, that she had induced the Moorish priests to write
several for her and had paid them well in <i>dragmes</i>, but that
they had produced no effect; she hoped that mine would turn out
better. The situation in which I now stood did not permit me to
reject this proposition: I only insisted upon the clause that she
should not put butter into the sangleh. Without loss of time she
fetched ink and a straw to use as a pen. She first told me the name
of the desired lover, and the names of his parents, and recommended
to me particularly to keep the secret: as she had no paper I
furnished her with a little bit, and wrote in her presence the
charm she wished for. To give it the more importance, I ordered it
to be tied round the neck of the young girl, which was immediately
done, and finally, to inspire a high idea of my skill in magic, I
traced upon a little board another talisman, directing that the
writing should be washed, and that her niece should drink of the
water which had been used for this purpose. This formality having
been punctually fulfilled, the girl came to ask me what time would
elapse before the charm would operate. As I knew that I should not
be many days in the country, I told her that it would probably not
be twenty before she was married. Her aunt Ayesha (this was the old
woman’s name) kept her word; she brought me on the morrow, in a
very dirty calabash, some sangleh made of barley-meal and without
seasoning. The daughters of Aly, having become more civil since I
had shewn my talent for bestowing husbands, ceased to molest me;
they came and offered me some fresh camel’s milk, and this was the
first time that I had drunk any in the dwelling of my host.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the good old aunt who had so strongly recommended
secresy to me, gave her friends information of the happy talent
which I possessed, and I soon had to write for the neighbouring
camps. All the women of the environs made friends with me that, I
might give them a charm which would procure husbands for their
daughters; they even went so far as to offer me money in payment,
which it will be easily imagined I was far from accepting; but I
made no scruple of taking milk and sangleh for my support:
profiting by this innocent stratagem, I had every day gruel or milk
for breakfast. Before chance furnished me with this method of
procuring food, I had given my host a little coussabe, entreating
him to send me each morning, at least, a small quantity of sangleh:
the old hypocrite kept my present, but gave me nothing in return.
One day I reproached him for his conduct, and he returned me my
coussabe: I changed it for a pair of morocco shoes, for I was
barefoot; in the middle of the day, the sun was so scorching, and
the gravel and dry herbage cut my feet so much, that I had been
obliged to borrow shoes to walk in.</p>

<p>The sons of Sidi-Aly, from twenty-eight to thirty years of age,
not wanting my assistance to find wives, did not treat me more
kindly than before; they continued to insult me up to the time of
my departure; they even carried their insolence so far as to
present themselves uncovered before me using the most indecent
gestures. Aly, their father, only laughed at this conduct, which he
witnessed.</p>

<p>The Arabs of el-Harib are so harassed by the Beraberas, or
Berbers, to whom they are tributary, that they are fearful of
travelling even in their own country without an escort from among
these people; for if these unfortunate Arabs were met by the
Berbers, they would be beaten and pillaged: for this reason we
could not proceed to Tafilet without an escort. We were therefore
obliged to wait for one of the chiefs of this nation, who lived in
a village of the Drah or Draha, and had been sent for.</p>

<p>On the 3rd of July, this chief arrived at the encampment Aly
gave him a good reception. They agreed upon the price which each
load should pay for transport from el-Harib to Tafilet—for this
Berber was to furnish beasts of burden; they signed a written
agreement in which they mutually bound themselves to fulfil their
engagements, and the Berber promised to return in eight days with
the camels. Tired of the monotonous life which I was leading in the
camp, I resolved for amusement to make a tour among the tribe of
Oulad-Gouassim to visit an eminent Mahometan priest, whose sanctity
had been highly extolled; his encampment lay about three miles to
the east of ours. I approached his tent at the moment when the holy
personage was coming out: several old men accompanied him; they had
heard me spoken of, and immediately informed him that I was
unhappy, and that I had separated from the christians. He answered
with an air of indifference and without appearing to take any
notice of me: “Well then! he has to thank God for his return into
the way of salvation.” I seated myself for a moment upon the ground
with him and some of the Moors, who were vicing with each other in
obsequiousness to him: he ordered one of them to fetch him a little
water, to dissolve some salt which he intended to take as a remedy
for an indisposition, pretending that this beverage would give him
relief. As the vessel which was brought to him was too full, he was
about to pour out some of the water, when one of the Moors in his
company, being apparently thirsty, proposed to drink it, but the
haughty priest, with a contemptuous air, asked who he was that he
should drink out of his satala: the person who aspired to this
favour was no doubt worthy of it, for no sooner had he mentioned
his name than the priest presented the vase to him. During the
short time that I remained in his presence I saw a number of Moors
come to consult him on divers maladies; his only remedy for so many
complaints was to lay his hand gravely upon the part affected, and,
rubbing it gently, to pronounce a prayer. This important person was
also the public writer and the instructor of the children.</p>

<p>The only wealth of this man consisted in his knowledge of the
Koran; but in Africa this knowledge is worth an estate. From all
parts they brought him cotton cloth for his dress, stuff for his
tent, beasts to carry him on his journeys, and barley for the food
of himself and his people: he received all this in exchange for the
charms which he wrote. In his camp he was abundantly furnished with
whatever could contribute to his support and that of his friends;
in return, he gave talismans for the cure or prevention of all
diseases, against thefts, or to obtain husbands for the young
females.</p>

<p>As it was late and I did not intend returning to Aly’s camp, and
as the priest had not given me an invitation to sleep in his tent,
I sought elsewhere a lodging for the night; I addressed myself as
is usual to the first man I met, and requested permission to sleep
near his tent: this man received me kindly, installed me in the
place which he usually occupied, and left me; he then sent me a
supply of dates to serve till supper time. I did not touch them,
being afraid of them. During the night I was visited by a Moor, who
was a cripple, and obliged to be carried by another. I was lying
upon the ground; on rising I was astonished to see this little man
beside me; he gave me the idea of a mysterious dwarf; I knew not
what to think of his nocturnal visit, and conceived that by the
assistance of his companion he intended to steal something. Finding
that their presence was not at all to my satisfaction, they desired
me not to be afraid, but I assured them loud enough to be heard by
the neighbours, that if they did not leave me, I should complain to
my host. The deformed dwarf threw himself into the arms of his
conductor and they disappeared like lightning. About ten o’clock at
night, my supper was brought me: it was good couscous with meat,
such as I had never eaten in Aly’s family. The chief of the tent
brought me water to wash my hands, inquired if I had had a good
supper, and took his seat beside me: he put several questions
relative to the customs of christian countries, and then
withdrew.</p>

<p>On the 4th of July, after taking leave of my generous host, I
returned to Aly’s camp. On the road I met two women, whose
conversation amused me a little. They begged me to write charms,
one to make her husband who intended to quit her change his mind;
another to procure a husband for a young woman who wished to marry:
they offered me money in exchange, but warned me, laughing, that
they should pay nothing till my charms had taken effect. This
conversation made the walk pleasant, and beguiled the length of the
way.</p>

<p>We arrived at the camp: the blacksmith, to whose tent I often
went to sleep, was preparing to transport two cargoes of ivory to
Tatta; I perceived that he paid dues to the Berbers to travel
through the country in safety. On making inquiries concerning the
place to which they were going, I learnt that Tatta is a large town
situated five days’ journey to the N. W. of our camp: the route
leads through the town of Brahihima, which is two days’ journey
from the camp. The goods taken to Tatta are dispatched thence by
the merchants of Soueyrah (Cape Mogador.)</p>

<p>On the 6th of July, the wife of Sidi-Aly, who till then, like
the rest of the family had given me tokens of ill-will accosted me
in a very affable tone, and requested a saphi for bad eyes;
promising me that if I effected a cure, she would give me every
thing I wished. To get quit of her I gave her one immediately, and
she received it with gratitude. I refused her money, but accepted
with pleasure a little milk which she offered me. After some days,
the impatient Mariam (that was her name) seeing that my amulet did
not operate, reproached me bitterly, saying that my skill was no
greater than that of the priests. Knowing from her husband that I
had some medicaments, she asked me for physic, which embarrassed me
greatly, as I was fearful of increasing her complaint; it was
necessary however to satisfy her, under penalty of being considered
disobliging. Convinced that cleanliness was the best remedy I could
prescribe, to force her to it, I diluted with a considerable
quantity of water a small portion of sulphat of quinine, and
desired her to wash her eyes with it; she insisted that I should
perform this operation myself, unfortunately the water, penetrating
to her eyes, made them smart a little: upon which she flew into a
rage, loaded me with abuse, and in conclusion, cursed both the
doctor and his medicines. From that time she gave me no more
sangleh.</p>

<p>This incident did not destroy their confidence in my saphies, to
the credit of which moreover old Aly had contributed by a
falsehood; having asserted that when I left Timbuctoo my abdomen
was much swelled, and that I wrote in a book, washed my writing in
water, and drank this liquor, which cured me.</p>

<p>An old woman long tormented me to procure a husband for her
daughter; she dragged me, at length, against my will into her tent,
which belonged to a neighbouring camp, promising me a draught of
<i>cheni</i> in recompense. Here I saw the object of her maternal
solicitude; a girl about twenty years of age, repulsively ugly,
clothed in rags, the filthiness of which could only be equalled by
that of her person. Her left cheek was covered by a scar, and she
had sore eyes. Her whole figure presented the most revolting
appearance imaginable; and I perceived at a glance the cause of her
mother’s anxiety to get her married by means of a charm. I felt
that it was quite beyond my art to accomplish such a prodigy. To
induce me however to exert all my skill, the old woman offered me a
piece of dried meat, which she took out of a large leathern sack,
where, from its state of putrefaction, it might have been deposited
on the day that her amiable daughter was born. Notwithstanding the
repugnance which I manifested, the mother insisted upon my
acceptance of the delectable morsel, which she assured me was
excellent; but such was my disgust that I even refused the
<i>cheni</i> which she offered. I was anxious to withdraw, but
could not effect my escape till I had written the amulet required;
this done, I fled with all expedition, invoking for the maiden a
man courageous enough to take her to wife.</p>

<p>I have never, in any country, seen women so dirty as those of
el-Harib. This total want of cleanliness is no doubt the cause of
the chronic ophthalmia, and other disorders, with which they and
their equally filthy offspring are afflicted. My medical reputation
drew upon me most unpleasant avocations: the mothers brought to me
in crowds children in so disgusting a state that I could not look
at them without horror; in vain did I avert my eyes, they only
became more importunate, compelling me to examine the miserable
beings for whom they solicited my aid. I could do no better for
them than recommend cleanliness; but this simple remedy they
despised, and would not be content with any thing short of the
marvellous.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 6th, a troop of Berbers arrived in our
camp demanding hospitality. Aly ordered for their supper a couscous
of wheat flour, to which were added some pieces of meat dried in
the sun. The food for me and the slaves was separately dressed; but
Aly’s sister, who, since I had given her amulets for her nieces,
had become much more attentive to me, gave me some of their meat
concealed under the bad couscous of barley intended for me.</p>

<p>On the 8th of July, another troop of Berbers carried off several
camels which were grazing at a distance. The whole camp took the
alarm, and arming themselves with guns the men set off in haste,
some on foot and others on horseback; but the thieves were already
distant, and their pursuers returned without having overtaken them.
The evening was spent in lamentations on the part of the owners of
the camels, their relations, and friends. They had recourse to
fortune-tellers to know if they should recover them, and came to
consult me on the subject, requesting a charm to bring them back;
this I refused, under pretence that my writings did not possess
that virtue.</p>

<p>On the 11th of July, the Berbers who were to escort us to
Tafilet arrived, and great was my joy to think that on the morrow I
should quit a place where I had experienced so many mortifications.
Aly had a sheep killed for the Berbers’ supper and gave me a little
bit, with an apology on account of the many persons who were to
partake of it.</p>

<p>On the 12th, at five o’clock in the morning, our preparations
were made for departure; but before quitting this country I shall
give a description of it.</p>

<p>The territory of el-Harib, two days’ journey west of that of
el-Drah, and one to the east of the tribe of the Trajacants, is
situated between two chains of mountains, which extend from east to
west, and separate it towards the north from the empire of Morocco,
to which it is tributary. The inhabitants are divided into several
roving tribes. Their principal wealth consists in the great
quantity of camels which they breed, and which in the wet season
produce abundance of milk for their sustenance. All the Moors of
el-Harib travel in the Soudan; they go to Timbuctoo, el-Arawan, and
Sansanding; the merchants of Tafilet, el-Drah, and Soueyrah, give
them loads for their camels; on their own account they carry only
wheat and dates, and these in small ventures. When in the Soudan
they remain there several months, for the purpose of traffic;
making little journeys to Toudeyni, where they purchase mineral
salt, which they sell again to the principal merchants in the two
chief entrepôts, receiving in exchange grain, the stuffs of the
Soudan, and gold. Having spent nine or ten months in this traffic,
they take a load for Tafilet or some other city, and afterwards
return into their own country and to their family, bringing with
them gold only and some slaves, whom they sell in Morocco.</p>

<p>On returning to their own country, they are obliged to pay a
small tribute to a chief called the sheikh. The goods brought by
the Moors from the Soudan to el-Harib are transported to Tafilet or
other places by the Berbers alone, or under escorts which they
furnish at a price agreed upon; without which precaution the
merchants would certainly be robbed or murdered on the road.</p>

<p>The Moors of this miserable country are incessantly harassed by
the Berbers, from whose habits of rapine they have every thing to
fear, although they pay them a heavy tribute; and not one of them,
whatever rank he may hold at home, dares travel without being thus
accompanied. These roving people, not being themselves cultivators
of the soil, are obliged frequently to go to el-Drah to purchase
barley and dates for food, and not daring to attempt this without
the convoy of the Berbers, they pay them an additional tribute by
way of remuneration. These latter, well armed, are continually
prowling about in the country of el-Harib, to obtain food from the
Moors and even to carry off their cattle.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of this district are so poor that they can
purchase only the cheapest provisions, principally such dates as,
having fallen from the trees before they have become perfectly
ripe, are carefully picked up by the owners, exposed to the sun to
dry, and then put into leathern bags, where they become so
extremely hard that very good teeth are requisite to eat them
without pain. Upon these dates, which they pound in a wooden
mortar, and a little cheni, the Moors of el-Harib subsist during
the day; eating sangleh before evening only in very particular
cases.</p>

<p>About eight or nine at night, they usually sup upon a couscous
of barley generally steeped in warm water, in which they have
boiled a handful of herbs gathered in the environ of their camp.
They also breed some sheep, but when they kill one, which is very
rarely done, they dry the meat and preserve it in leathern sacks,
sometimes for six months. They have recourse to this reserve when
they treat strangers, particularly the Berbers, to whom they are
very attentive. As a mark of consideration, they spread before the
tent for their repose a carpet as good as those which we use in
Europe. The master, in honour of his guests, frequently eats with
them from the same bowl, and, instead of offering them pure water,
he adds to it camel’s milk, which in the rainy season is very
abundant. On the arrival of the strangers, the dates and cheni are
immediately set before them as a refreshment till the supper hour.
Though the Moors of el-Harib receive the Berbers thus hospitably,
yet in travelling through their country they are never treated even
with a supper; in their journeys therefore, they are careful to
carry their provision of dates and a little barley-meal, which they
boil in water. The costume of the Berbers differs from that of the
Moors only in a band of coloured stuff, which the former wrap round
their heads in the form of a turban; they also wear ear-rings. They
are all armed and mounted on fine horses, handsomely caparisoned,
and they wear spurs, which are attached to a leather strap firmly
fastened round the instep.</p>

<p>The Moors of el-Harib dress like those on the banks of the
Senegal, except that over their coussabe they wear a linen wrapper
manufactured in the country of el-Drah or Tafilet. They have only
one wife, but like the Braknas change her frequently. They are all
Musulmans, yet they do not addict themselves, like the marabouts,
to the study of the Koran, being satisfied with knowing the first
verse of it without learning to write; a marabout is, consequently,
held in great consideration among them.</p>

<p>The Moors of el-Harib are generally detested by their
neighbours; in el-Drah and Tafilet they are seldom called any thing
but cafirs or infidels. In my life I never saw women so evil
disposed and so dirty as those of this country: they do not veil
themselves, like the women of Morocco, but expose a face
disgustingly filthy; the smell that proceeds from them is most
offensive. The inhabitants eat the camels which have died from
fatigue, but not till they have drained off the blood; they keep
some sheep and a few horses. El-Harib contains eleven tribes, the
names of which, as I received them from an old inhabitant of the
camp to which I belonged, are as follows: Oulad-Rossik,
Oulad-Wébal, Oulad-Gouessim, Oulad-Foulh, Oulad-Ouraff,
Oulad-Rouzinn, Oulad-Rahan, Oulad-Nasso, Oulad-Body,
Oulad-Bonlaboi, Oulad-Sidi-Ayesha. One day’s journey west from our
camp are situated the first tents of the Trajacants; at the
distance of four in the same direction are the tribes of
Oulad-Noun, who dwell near the village of Adrar, which must not be
confounded with the country of el-Drah, a small district extending
from east to West, and from north to south, between Morocco and
el-Harib; five days’ journey west from the encampment of Sidi-Aly
is the village of Sous; at fourteen days in the same direction that
of Soueyrah; and at ten or eleven days from el-Harib, to the N. N.
W. is Morocco, the capital of the empire of that name, which these
rovers sometimes visit.</p>

<p>While the men of el-Harib are travelling in the Soudan, the
women employ themselves in making ropes of grass, to fasten the
baggage and to draw water from the wells in the deserts; they spin
camel’s hair with which they make tent-covers; they prepare and tan
leather, and make sandals for their husbands, and the remainder of
their time is devoted to their domestic concerns. As in all other
Mahometan countries, they eat apart from the men.</p>

<p>Sidi-Aly had frequently teased me to part with my two pieces of
blue cotton cloth from the Soudan, that I might have, he said, the
means of purchasing provisions for my journey to Tafilet, those
which had been given me at Timbuctoo and el-Arawan, having been
wholly consumed by himself and his family. Wishing to retain my
cloths, which might probably prove serviceable to me in future, I
resisted his importunities, and thus cheating his cupidity ran the
risk of exposing myself to his resentment. My resolution, however,
produced no ill consequences.</p>

<p>On the 12th of July, we set out at five in the morning, after
having taken a little camel’s milk, which I bought with a glass
bead from my chaplet. We proceeded slowly towards the east, over a
hard soil, composed of grey sand, covered with vegetation, and
intersected with deep ravines. Aly would not permit me to mount my
camel all the morning; it was not till towards noon when he mounted
himself that I could obtain this favour. About two <span class=
"sc2">P. M.</span> we halted on a very hard sand upon which grew
some zizyphus lotus; throughout the day a strong easterly wind
incommoded us much: at four in the evening it veered to the west.
At nightfall we were visited by a Moorish priest whose camp was in
the vicinity of our halting place. As he was proprietor of several
flocks of sheep, we wished to purchase some mutton of him but he
refused; and we gave him some barley-meal which he undertook that
his wife should dress for our suppers. He sent it to us at ten
o’clock, and had the civility to add some milk from his ewes. Out
of reserve he declined supping with us, but seated himself apart
and waited till the dish containing our mess was brought to
him.</p>

<p>On the 13th of July, at two in the morning, we continued our
route E. N. E., and crossed several sand-hills covered with dry
shrubs. About eight o’clock we passed the ruins of some mud-huts,
surrounded by a battlemented wall; opposite to these ruins is a
small square mausoleum, the roof of which is a vaulted arch.
Immediately within the little entrance door, is stretched a cord
from which depend numerous shreds of cloth of various colours,
which travellers had hung there from a sentiment of devotion.
Several pyramids of flint heaped together without cement, and about
eighteen inches in height, are another kind of offering made by
passengers to the manes of the sherif whose ashes repose in this
monument, and whose memory is held in veneration.</p>

<p>Here the Moors and Berbers of our little caravan went through
their devotions; after a short ceremony they took a little sand
from the place in which they had prostrated themselves and
sprinkled it over their camels and slaves. I learned that these
ruins belonged to an ancient village called Zawât, long since
abandoned by its inhabitants, who had elsewhere founded another
town of the same name.</p>

<p>The soil of the environs is barren, hard, and full of stones of
various colours; a few bushes indeed are to be seen, but their
foliage is parched up by the sun.</p>

<p>It was noon when we passed the new village of Zawât, which
belongs to the country of el-Drah. This village is peopled by the
former inhabitants of the deserted ruins we had seen in the
morning: the houses are of stone, with terraced roofs, and consist
only of a ground-floor; they are ill-built and resemble the huts of
the Bambaras. We crossed some fields which had been cultivated, and
about half past twelve halted in a wood of date-trees, near a neat
village, called el-Hamit. Nothing was to be seen on all sides but
forests of date-trees majestically rearing their summits to the
clouds. Under these trees the inhabitants of el-Drah cultivate
wheat, barley, and some garden vegetables. They divide their land,
the soil of which is a fine sand but fertile, into little squares,
round which they raise dikes to receive and retain the rain-water,
and when they have collected more than they want they convey the
surplus by channels to the foot of the date-trees. Each landholder
has in the middle of his field a well of clear and good water, sunk
to the depth of twenty or twenty-five feet, in a hard sand mixed
with small black and yellow pebbles; I remarked several having
strata from fourteen to eighteen inches thick of red sand a little
veined with grey and of the consistence of clay. Two posts fifteen
feet high are erected, one on each side of these wells supporting a
cross-beam, to which is fastened a long pole, bearing a weight at
its hinder extremity to counterbalance the bucket which is attached
by a piece of cord to the other; the water is thus drawn-up without
much effort and serves to water their plantations. At the depth of
about twenty-five feet are found rocks which appear to be of
granite. Wood is very scarce in this country; the fuel consists
only of dry palm-leaves and the trunks of dead trees: the timber
used in the construction of their houses is that of the
date-tree.</p>

<p>The plough is used in this country, and it is drawn by mules or
camels.</p>

<p>Near sunset the Berbers collected some small pebbles, which they
arranged symmetrically upon the sand, then heated them with a fire
of palm-leaves, and, after kneading a little barley-meal, baked a
cake of it for our supper upon the stones; to improve it they mixed
with the meal some small bits of mutton fat; when baked it was
divided among us. Aly gave me a little bit of it which I thought
delicious, although badly baked and very heavy, for I had tasted
nothing the whole day; my guide, however, though he allowed me so
little nourishment, upbraided me with living at his expense, since
my own provisions had been long exhausted. Happily for me two
Trajacant marabouts had joined our caravan; Aly supplied them with
provisions, and allowed them sometimes to ride his camels, not out
of humanity, but because he would have utterly forfeited his
reputation as a pious Musulman had he acted otherwise. These two
men were excellent company to me: they consoled me under the
insults to which I was incessantly exposed, and greatly alleviated
the hardships of my lot during this long and toilsome journey; for
I should probably have encountered still worse usage but for their
presence, which imposed some restraint on my guide and his family.
The marabouts had even the kindness to give me drink, when, as it
frequently happened, water was refused me.</p>

<p>On the 14th at three in the morning, we took our departure,
slowly directing our course E. N. E., through numerous plantations
of dates; the soil was broken by hills of loose sand.</p>

<p>About eight in the morning, we passed a large village called
Bounou, surrounded by beautiful palm-trees. About ten we came to a
hard soil covered with small black and yellow pebbles; here we met
six Berber horsemen, all well mounted, and armed with sabres and
muskets; they advanced at full speed to meet us with hostile
intentions, pointing their loaded muskets: the six Berbers who
formed our escort, with four well armed Moors, placed themselves at
the head of the cavalcade, holding their weapons in readiness to
receive the enemy. The two parties halted within a certain
distance, when the Berbers parleyed together in their own language,
still holding their muskets ready for firing. As soon as they
recognised each other to be countrymen, they saluted; and we
pursued our route without molestation. What a country is this, in
which it is impossible to stir a step without danger of being
robbed and even murdered by one’s neighbours! We continued our
course in the same direction over a hard and stony soil, and passed
an ancient village in ruins, where the minaret of a mosque is still
to be seen; beside it is a well at which travellers quench their
thirst; one of the Trajacant Moors gave me a little of this water,
which I found tepid and bad. I also observed a mausoleum, like that
which we had seen the day before, and where the Musulmans again
performed their devotions. Proceeding in the same direction, we met
some wretched Moors, leading asses laden with forage; these men
were badly clothed and walked barefoot.</p>

<p>About noon we encamped in the fields under the shade of some
date trees and not far from Mimcina, a large town of el-Drah,
inhabited by Berber and Moorish husbandmen. This town, surrounded
by walls twelve-feet high, is situated between two chains of hills
stretching east and west, the soil of which every where presents a
reddish hue, without any trace of vegetation.</p>

<p>As it was hot, and our people were not yet returned from
watering the camels at the wells, my thirst became extreme, and I
determined to visit the tents of the Berbers, pitched at a short
distance from our own, to beg a little water.</p>

<p>No sooner did I approach the camp than three large dogs rushed
upon me, tore my garments and bit me in several places. I cried
aloud to the Berbers for assistance, but these unfeeling wretches
carelessly looked on or turned away with the utmost indifference:
assailed by so many enemies I found the combat very unequal; and,
for fear of being torn in pieces, sounded a retreat, still
sustaining some bites as I retired: the dogs carried off some
pieces of my dress as trophies, and did not leave me till I was at
a considerable distance from their tents. Heartily cursing the
inhumanity of their masters, I returned sorrowfully to our own camp
under the date-trees. The Berbers keep a great number of dogs to
watch their flocks, and they are so accustomed not to suffer the
approach of any stranger whatsoever to the habitations of which
they are left in charge, that the fear of being devoured by them
serves as a wholesome restraint upon the depredations of those
robbers by whom the country is so much infested. The Berbers
themselves dare not approach without caution the camps of their own
tribe to which they are strangers; but, if business obliges them to
repair thither, they take the following method to escape the fury
of these pitiless guardians. The visiter advances slowly, and makes
a circuit round the tents at a considerable distance; the dogs
begin to bark, without advancing on account of the distance; as
soon as the owners of the tents shew themselves, he acquaints them
with the object of his coming, when they are anxious to satisfy
him; if he applies for hospitality, supper is spread for him on a
mat at a short distance from the tents, which no one is ever
allowed to enter.</p>

<p>At five in the evening, when the heat was abated, I took a walk
to the town of Mimcina, accompanied by a neighbouring Moor, who,
being a friend of Sidi-Aly’s, had come to visit him and brought him
a present of dates, which, by the invitation of the donor, we ate
together. The chief of our Berbers strongly recommended me to this
Moor, and charged him especially to guard me from insult and not to
suffer me to be robbed of the pagne which I wore; a recommendation
which gave me but an indifferent opinion of the people whom I was
about to visit. The town is walled and surrounded by pleasant
plantations of palm-trees. I observed under a shed near the gate a
party of loungers, who, as soon as they saw me, crowded round me
asking a thousand ridiculous questions, for they were already
apprised that I was an Arab who had escaped from the christians.
With some trouble I got quit of these impertinent fellows, and,
penetrating into the town, I passed through a very narrow, winding,
and dirty street; the walls of the houses are at least fifteen feet
high and very badly plaistered. I was followed by a crowd of men,
for the women were veiled and durst not look at me. I seated myself
under a gallery, where many old men were collected together in
conversation with one of our Trajacants, who had been in the town
all day, and had already related part of my history to the
assembly. Among the crowd was an aged Moor, who, having performed
two journeys to Mecca, had acquired great preponderance over their
counsels: this man talked to me a long time about the christians,
and shewed me a fac-simile of the manner in which Christ is
represented in Europe; he tried to chant in imitation of the
priests whom he had heard at Tripoli in Barbary, and often
repeated, striking his breast, <i>amen, amen</i>. He asked me if I
was disposed to eat some dates, for which I thanked him. The
Trajacant marabout told him that I was with a guide named Aly, who
persecuted me in order to force me to sell my dress and purchase
provisions for the journey; the old man appeared incensed at such
perfidious conduct, and declared that such a person could not be a
good Musulman. He inquired whether I would like a present of dates,
which I accepted; and he immediately ordered those about him to
provide me with a sufficient quantity to last till our arrival at
Tafilet; and leading me to the mosque reiterated his orders. After
the prayers, a great quantity of dates was brought to me, enough
indeed to load an ass; but unfortunately they turned out to be
spoilt and bad: these good people carried their complaisance so far
as to carry them to our camp; bad as they were, Aly, the covetous
Aly, received them with pleasure, and on that day behaved better to
me than usual.</p>

<p>The houses of Mimcina consist of a ground-floor, only; like
those of Timbuctoo, they have terraced roofs, and admit the air
only from an inner court. I saw several dirty Jewesses, covered
with rags, walking barefoot, and displaying the utmost extremity of
wretchedness. The inhabitants of Mimcina have but few beasts of any
kind, and scarcely any oxen or horned cattle: they breed a few
sheep for the sake of their wool, some goats and poultry; they are
excellent husbandmen, and have many date-trees, in which their
wealth principally consists. Their breakfast is composed of bread
with a little gruel made of barley-meal; and they sup upon
couscous. About seven o’clock a plentiful couscous with mutton was
sent to Sidi-Aly, who, after having made his own supper with two or
three persons whom he looked upon as his equals, shared the
remainder between me and six camel-drivers, who were not admitted
to his table: the poor slaves also, to my great satisfaction, were
not forgotten. We afterwards lay down under the palm-trees, the
broad leaves of which formed a canopy over our heads, and I,
contrary to my usual habit, slept tolerably well.</p>

<p>On the 15th, at three in the morning, we took leave of the town
of Mimcina and its inhabitants; and, bending our course E. N. E.,
traversed a hard soil of white sand, with a surface of small
pebbles of the same colour, mixed with gravel; the country is
diversified with hills of an extremely arid appearance. The Moors
of Mimcina informed me that Beneali, the residence of the chief of
the Berbers, is situated N. N. W. of their town, at the distance of
a day’s journey, on the road to Morocco. This nation, according to
their account, pays no tribute to the emperor.</p>

<p>A day’s journey from Beneali in the same direction lies the
village of Amsero; a days’ journey beyond that Ranguerute, a large
town, and six days farther still Morocco, the capital of the
empire.</p>

<p>Six days’ journey east of Mimcina is situated the town of
Tabelbât, on the road to Tawât, which is eight days’ journey
beyond. The Moors of Tawât are husbandmen; they have numerous
palm-trees, trade with Timbuctoo, and occasionally visit Tafilet
and el-Drah to purchase goats and sheep.</p>

<p>Pursuing our route, we arrived at the wells of Yeneguedel, where
we halted: a quarter of mile to the south we saw a delightful grove
of palms, offering a striking contrast with the barrenness of the
neighbouring mountains; but our guides neglected this spot, where
we might have enjoyed the shade, and left us exposed to the
scorching sun, which on that day was more than usually powerful. I
visited the wells, situated on a little hill, as bare as the
neighbouring country, and there found a single drooping <i>mimosa
ferruginea</i>, under which I stretched myself, and, resting my
head on a stone, slept soundly. On awaking, I approached the wells
to drink, and saw there some Berber women watering their sheep: the
wells are three feet deep, and their water is good and abundant;
they are sunk in grey sand, containing many calcareous stones of a
flat shape. On our departure from Mimcina, we had been joined by a
Moor from Tafilet: he and his train were mounted upon mules, the
animals most commonly used for travelling this stony road, which is
apt to wound the feet of camels; those of Sidi-Aly were however
obliged to carry his goods.</p>

<p>The Berbers had a barley-cake baked upon the ashes for our
supper; each of us after this light repast, drank a glass of cold
water, and lay down for the night on the stony ground.</p>

<p>On the 16th, at three in the morning, we proceeded slowly N. N.
E., till near eight, when our course was changed to the north. Our
march lay over a very mountainous soil, covered with sharp stones,
which were very troublesome. The mountains are not high, and
composed of granite without any appearance of vegetation. The Moor
Sidi-Boby, who still perpetually insulted me, threw a stone at me,
which striking me on the right side, hurt me much, and I retained
the mark of it a considerable time: this brute had no other cause
for such savage treatment than my having mounted my camel without
giving him notice. Old Aly, seated upon his, had preceded us;
immediately on rejoining him, I complained of the outrageous
treatment to which I had been exposed; but he paid little attention
to me and answered laughing: “That is nothing, all will be well.”
Exasperated by his conduct, I told him that if all was well with
him, all was very ill with me: he was silent, and turned his head
another way. I ought to repeat here that it was to the two
Trajacant marabouts alone that I was indebted for not encountering
still worse treatment from such men, in the journey between el-Drah
and Tafilet: I thanked them for it; but for them I should have been
obliged either to desert, or to seek another guide to conduct me to
Ghourland. The Moors of my company were restrained from doing me
greater mischief solely by the fear of passing for infidels.</p>

<p>About ten in the morning, we halted near the wells of Faratissa,
agreeably shaded by beautiful palms: in the environs are some veins
of sand, studded with patches of grass on which the camels are
accustomed to browse; stunted mimosas are also scattered around.
The wells are but two feet and a half deep; the water is very
good.</p>

<p>From el-Drah, our little party had been increased by several
Moors; they all assembled round the wells, and talked much about
me; with the exception of my guide all appeared to take an interest
in my fate: fears were expressed that on my arrival in Alexandria I
might not meet with any parents. “Poor young man,” said they, “what
will he do all alone?” I told them that I had full confidence in
God, who had supported me through a thousand dangers and would not
abandon me at the moment of reaching port. “In short,” said I, “if
God has called to himself my father and mother, he will have left
me a brother and a sister.”</p>

<p>On such occasions Aly spoke highly in my favour and even pitied
me: this day he carried his kindness so far as to shave my head, a
compliment which I would willingly have dispensed with; but, as it
was a religious duty, I could not complain. In the very act he
proved his hypocrisy by insulting me, and encouraging his slaves to
follow his example. To escape these persecutions, I took refuge in
the tents of the Moors, our fellow-travellers, where we passed the
night under the palms, the coolness of whose foliage invited us to
sleep. The camels and mules not having had water the whole day, we
rested till three in the afternoon of the 17th.</p>

<p>The intense heat having then moderated, we proceeded northward,
over a soil similar to that of the preceding day. About half past
six we stopped, and each of us supped upon a piece of barley-cake
and some dates. After this meagre repast, we again stretched
ourselves upon the stony ground, where I slept soundly till about
three in the morning of the 18th, when we started afresh.</p>

<p>As my guide was fearful of fatiguing his camel, he obliged me to
walk the whole morning: I therefore followed on foot the little
caravan, which slowly advanced towards the N. N. E. over a gravelly
soil; the face of the country was covered with hills composed of
rocks of granite. About nine in the morning, we halted at the wells
of Bohayara, around which the vegetation is luxuriant; they are
twelve feet deep, and sunk in grey sand, mingled with coarse
gravel. They are very near to a camp of Berbers, who water their
sheep and goats at them: these men inhabit the passes of the
mountains, where they feed numerous flocks of sheep and herds of
camels, and cultivate a little barley and wheat. They are rovers,
but change their place of abode less frequently than the Moors, and
whenever occasion calls them to a distance from their little
fields, they always leave some one behind to take care of them.</p>

<p>I found the Berber women much cleaner and less curious than the
Moorish. They dress like the latter in old rags, but take care to
wash them. These women, whose good looks proclaim that they live in
plenty, colour the tips of their noses and chins blue; they envelop
their heads in ragged cloths of red or white worsted, and wear
their hair in tufts behind their ears, and fastened in rolls at the
back of their heads. Their principal ornaments consist of necklaces
of amber, coral, and various kinds of glass-beads, and in silver
bracelets and anclets; their skin however appeared to be as dirty
as that of the Moorish females of el-Harib. They are industrious,
and employ themselves in spinning the wool of their sheep, and
weaving the yarn into blankets, which they sell at Tafilet. These
Berbers have a peculiar idiom, which the Arabs do not speak; they
also conform to the religion of Mahomet; they have several wives,
who superintend all the household concerns, prepare the food, take
care of the sheep, and have besides the laborious task of drawing
water for them to drink. They pasture their flocks in the passes of
the mountains wheresover they can find herbage, for the appearance
of their own country is absolutely bare. Hills of granite, of
moderate height, but totally destitute of vegetation, meet the eye
on all sides. This wandering and pastoral tribe subsist like the
Moors, upon dates and sangleh made of barley; they often make their
supper upon couscous, or barley-cake, baked upon the ashes. In the
rainy season, the milk of their flocks, being then more abundant,
forms a portion of their nourishment. Such of them as live in the
villages have houses in the Moorish style, built like those of the
Arab inhabitants of the towns: the rovers have only tents, the
coverings of which are made of the hair of their camels. They grow
but little grain, the land which they occupy being scarcely fit for
cultivation; but here and there may be traced veins of more fertile
earth which they turn to good account.</p>

<p>Their cookery, like that of the Moors of el-Harib, is performed
in large copper vessels, manufactured by native smiths. It is
astonishing that they escape being poisoned by the verdigris, for
the Moorish women are so excessively dirty that they never wash
their utensils, merely rubbing off with the hand what adheres to
the sides.</p>

<p>The Berbers encamped at Bohayara presented Sidi-Aly and our
escort with a sheep, which had a particularly fine fleece, and was
killed by the Berbers of our company for our supper. As we had no
vessel to boil it in, our guides had recourse to the ingenious
expedient of picking up a number of large smooth calcareous stones,
with which they formed a small oven, and heated it with roots of
<i>hedysarum alhagi</i>, the only combustible that grows in this
part. The entrails of the sheep were converted into chitterlings
and the carcase was cut into many small parts.</p>

<p>The oven, when strongly heated, was carefully swept, and the
pieces of mutton put in one upon another; it was then hermetically
sealed with loose sand. When the meat was properly dressed, the
chief of our Berbers, who was a lover of justice, secured its
impartial distribution by giving each of us a bit of wood, which,
being duly marked, was brought to one of the Moors appointed for
the purpose. He was ordered to shake them together, and taking them
up at random, to place each upon a piece of the meat: thus every
one was entitled to his own lot. I had also my share, for which I
was solely indebted to the chief of the Berbers, who had been often
indignant at the conduct of the Moors towards me. The meat was
pretty good, served with cleanliness, and perfectly well
dressed.</p>

<p>On the 19th of July, at four in the morning, we quitted the
delicious wells of Bohayara, slowly directing our course N. N. E.
over a soil covered with small grey gravel; on either side of our
route was a chain of low, bare hills, containing abundance of black
granite, in huge detached blocks; and the country was still naked,
presenting its usual appearance of frightful sterility.</p>

<p>About ten, after proceeding at the rate of three miles an hour,
the wells of Goud-Zenaga afforded us a resting place; here we found
some Berbers from an adjacent camp who were watering their flocks.
The aspect of the country around led me into reflections upon the
habits and character of these people; it seems inconceivable how
they can contentedly take up their abode in such dreary regions,
producing nothing but scanty herbage, and neither tree nor shrub of
any kind.</p>

<p>On the 20th, at four <span class="sc2">A. M.</span> we again
pursued our course to N. N. E., over a nearly similar soil, but
somewhat stony; the chain of hills still continued equally
bare.</p>

<p>At eleven, we halted at the wells of Zénatyia, twenty or
twenty-four feet deep, yielding abundance of tolerably good water.
The surrounding soil presents a pleasing appearance of vegetation;
some mimosas and <i>zizyphus lotus</i> flourish there, together
with a number of very tall tamarisks, which afforded us an
agreeable shade. The level is broken by hills of loose white sand,
the abode of numerous antelopes, one of which was killed by a Moor
of our party, and divided amongst the whole caravan, allowing only
a small share to each.</p>

<p>A day’s journey N. W. of the wells of Zénatyia, is a Berber
town, called el-Yabo, and one of its inhabitants who belonged to
our caravan parted from us here to return home. The husbandmen of
el-Yabo extend their labours, during the rainy season, as far as
Zénatyia, preparing the ground for wheat and barley, which they
cultivate in small quantities.</p>

<p>On the 21st, we again proceeded towards N. N. E., at four in the
morning, travelling three miles in about an hour, among the hills
of loose sand. We then came to a plain of smooth sand firmer than
that of the hills, covered with small gravel and pebbles. About
ten, we halted at the wells of Chanérou, where we found some
Berbers watering their sheep, the fleeces of which are remarkably
white.</p>

<p>Near these wells I observed a small shed, constructed of the
branches of the <i>zizyphus lotus</i>, and covered with straw and
brambles: here I took shelter in company with some Moors, and three
Berber women, who left the task of questioning me to the men, paid
apparently but little attention to my adventures, when cursorily
related to them; but my person seemed to attract much of their
notice, and to please them greatly. Now and then I asked them for
some water; which they good-humouredly gave me from the bucket,
carefully holding it in a position that enabled me to drink with
ease.</p>

<p>The plain, in which these wells are situated, is gravelly,
interspersed with rocks, and inclosed by sterile hills, which seem
to be about three hundred and fifty feet in height. A little grass
grows in the clefts of these rocks, and serves the sheep for
pasturage. We had been joined in the morning by a Moor from
Tafilet, who came to meet his father. The old man, whose name was
Sidi-Abdoul-Rahman, was about fifty-five or sixty years of age, and
nearly bald: he was returning to his native village, Ghourland,
after a long residence at Timbuctoo; where he had seen Major Laing,
as he informed me by the way. His son brought him some black grapes
for his refreshment; he gave me a bunch with a small bit of wheaten
bread, which I accepted with pleasure. Little, indeed, had I
expected to eat fresh bread and grapes in so sterile a country! In
the evening, some troops of Berbers came to water their flocks.
Sidi-Aly proposed to buy a sheep for our supper, the Berbers of
another troop joined us, and twenty of them contributed towards
this purchase; each gave for his share a <i>dragme</i>, the coin of
the country, worth about eight French sous. Sidi-Aly whom I had
allowed to see that I possessed three or four shillings, consented
to lend me this dragme, which I promised to repay on our arrival at
Tafilet. I must here anticipate by observing, as a fact which
greatly surprised me, that at parting he would not accept payment;
desiring that I would keep this piece of money to assist me on my
journey to Fez, and saying that he gave it me for the love of God.
It was doubtless from remorse of conscience which he wished to
silence at a cheap rate. The mutton thus procured, and which was
dressed like the last, proved delicious, though it had not been so
carefully cleaned.</p>

<p>On the 22nd, at two o’clock in the morning, we set off in a N.
N. E. direction; the soil still the same, and the mountains
extending on both sides of our route. About ten in the forenoon we
halted at the wells of Nyéla, (or Ain-Yela) the water of which is
abundant and good; they are situated in a very stony ravine, and so
shallow that the water is taken up by hand. The heat was extreme,
and our only shelter some of the <i>zizyphus lotus</i>.</p>

<p>At a short distance south of the wells is seen a high mountain
of granite, in the crevices of which there are a few patches of
verdure: I observed on its declevity a flock of sheep, which
appeared no larger than young lambs. This mountain is nearly
pointed, and rises to the height of one hundred and fifty or two
hundred fathoms above the level of a very stony soil. When my
fellow-travellers had retired to rest for the night I went to the
wells with a satala, and washed myself in the cold water, which
afforded me much comfort; returning afterwards to my companions and
lying down on the ground, I slept soundly till three o’clock in the
morning.</p>

<p>On the 23rd, I was still half asleep when we set out, proceeding
for the first half hour in a N. N. E. direction; we afterwards
turned to the N. E., till six in the morning, and, quitting the
barren mountains, descended into a plain of very hard grey sand,
susceptible of cultivation.</p>

<p>From this plain we beheld the beautiful and majestic palm-trees
of the country of Tafilet, an enchanting prospect and one which
raised my spirits by announcing the speedy alleviation of my
sufferings. We passed through fields, separated, some by earth
walls, and others by narrow ditches. The country was beautiful, but
parched up by the scorching heat of the sun, which left no other
verdure than the evergreen leaves of the palm. About nine in the
morning we reached Ghourland, and were presently surrounded by a
crowd of children, attracted by curiosity. We encamped under the
shade of the palm-trees, at the gates of the town. When the arrival
of our caravan from the Soudan was reported, numbers of dirty and
ill-clad Moors and Jews came to meet us, and soon surrounded the
baggage: many of my companions warned me to be careful of my
leathern bag and of my pagnes, or they would be stolen, even off my
back; they advised me not to go too far from the village, because
there were thieves, who, in the supposition that I had brought much
gold from the Soudan, might attack me. The Moorish merchants who
came for their goods made a single mule carry the burden of a
camel. I took mine upon my shoulder and followed my guide to the
house of old Haggi-Le-Mekke, the chief of Ghourland. I passed in my
way through several long and narrow streets, and arrived at the
house of my new host. An inner court formed the entrance both to
the chambers and magazines. Part of this court was covered by a
shed, supported by trunks of palm-trees, in the middle of which was
a sort of sky-light. A staircase of earth led to the terraced roof
of the house. I deposited the bag containing my notes in a
locked-up warehouse, and, the bag itself being padlocked, I was set
at ease respecting the curiosity of the Moors. Our host gave us for
breakfast some excellent dates, so ripe that they resembled
preserves, and added a small piece of new wheaten bread: this would
have been a sumptuous regale, had not the water which we drank with
it been brackish. The young sons of Haggi received me kindly; they
congratulated me more particularly upon the resolution I had taken
to forsake the christians and unite myself with the Musulmans;
telling me that I was under the special protection of God, and that
all who should do me good would be favorites with the prophet. I
need not, they added, feel any further uneasiness as to my return
to my country; now that I was at Tafilet, I should find no
difficulty in reaching the place of my birth, and they would
themselves defray the expense of my journey to Fez, which should
cost me nothing. In conclusion, they invited me to remain with
them, assuring me that they would supply all my wants.</p>

<p>My new hosts seemed so well disposed towards me that I expected
an apartment at their house, but was disappointed, for, after
breakfast, they recommended me to go and engage a lodging at the
mosque, an edifice destined at once for the service of God and the
reception of travellers. In fact, I there met with several
strangers, who surrounded me and overwhelmed me with questions.</p>

<p>About two in the afternoon, I returned to the house of my host,
to relieve the weariness which this importunate curiosity
occasioned me, and was greatly astonished to find the same young
men, who in the morning had expressed so much affection for me, now
refuse me admittance. After having explained that they treated me
thus on account of their women, they asked me if I wanted food,
and, giving me about two ounces of bread with some dates, left me
seated upon the ground at the door. After having taken this slight
repast I returned to the mosque. About ten o’clock, the negro
slaves came to call Sidi-Aly and his people to supper: as he would
not allow me to eat with him, I received no notice; however,
finding the time elapse, and being by no means disposed to lose my
supper, I determined to seat myself at the door of my host’s house.
The slaves, as they passed, inquired what I wanted; I answered that
I had had no supper, and begged they would inform their master:
they executed my commission, and returned saying, that I ought to
have shared the supper of Sidi-Aly and his suite. I then described
their misconduct towards me, at which they were indignant, saying,
that he and his were infidels; and, desiring me to wait a moment,
they brought me an ample quantity of bad barley couscous, with a
small bit of beef. I afterwards went to sleep under the roof of the
mosque, among the Moors, who were necessitated like myself to take
refuge there. As the sons of Haggi-Le-Mekke had represented to me,
no stranger is here admitted into the interior of the houses, lest
the women, who are not allowed to see any other men but those of
their family, might be exposed to indiscreet observation:
consequently travellers obtain an asylum for the night in the
mosques, and the host at whose house they alight sends them their
meals; they send for them at supper time, but receive them in a
very dark corridor.</p>

<p>At eight o’clock in the morning, I went to my host’s for my
breakfast, and seated myself, as on the preceding afternoon, at the
door, waiting for an invitation. The youngest son of the family
soon came, and inquired very kindly if I had breakfasted; on my
answering in the negative, he ordered a slave to bring me some
dates and gruel made of barley-meal: this gruel is very thin, and
serves for a beverage in eating the fruit; with bread or couscous
they drink nothing but water. With a stomach thus slightly
supported the stranger is obliged to await the hour of supper, when
a little couscous is given him; this is the nourishment they
provide for those who ask hospitality of them, and for their
slaves. The masters drink with their breakfast a very thin gruel
made of wheat flour, and dine upon new bread and the fruits of the
season; they have abundance of fine melons, of which they are very
fond; and the richer inhabitants of Tafilet breakfast upon tea with
bread and figs. At ten at night, the usual hour of supper, they eat
couscous made of wheat flour, dressed with mutton or poultry, for
they rear some domestic fowls.</p>

<p>While sitting at the corner of a street I made acquaintance with
a Moor, named Sidi-Baubacar; who put some questions to me very
prudently, and appeared to interest himself in my situation; he is
a very mild and good man. He had travelled to Cape Mogador and to
Morocco, and in the former town had had much intercourse with the
christians, whom, in common with all other Moors, he detested. He
shewed some taste for the sciences and was desirous of instruction,
had learned arithmetic, and was well acquainted with its first
three rules, in which he could prove his calculations. He was in
the habit of writing upon a slate, which he brought to me, and we
made some calculations together. This man was somewhat of an
enthusiast, and conceived a friendship for me; he spoke much of the
knowledge of the Europeans, which he considered as vastly superior
to that of the Moors, and shewed me a watch to which he attached
much value, because he was the only person in the country who had
one. It was at his house that I saw the English pocket compass,
which I formerly mentioned. He talked of Bonaparte and his
campaigns in Egypt, asked if it was during his residence among the
Musulmans that I was made prisoner, and said that he was at Tripoli
about that time; finally he inquired my age; as I was covered with
rags, was ill, and my complexion scorched almost to blackness by
the heat of the sun, I appeared older than I really was; he had
therefore no difficulty in believing that I was thirty-four years
of age.</p>

<p>On the 26th, I proposed to a poor Jew named Jacob, to purchase
of me a shilling by weight, because, as this coin was not current
in the country, and he was a smith and a worker in gold and silver,
he could turn it to account in his trade. He required me, for this
purpose, to come to his house, to satisfy his curiosity no doubt;
however the proposal also answered mine, for I knew not by what
method to obtain admission to the interior of even one house. I
entered then the humble dwelling of this Jew; who conducted me
through two small low rooms, very dark and exceedingly dirty, into
a third, somewhat larger, which received light and air only by a
small opening in the roof: this opening is common to all the
apartments in the interior of the house, the dwellings of the Jews
being as simply constructed as those of the Moors.</p>

<p>Jacob, who did not possess a mat, was obliged to seat me upon
the ground. He opened a closet, and fetched some nuts which he
presented to me, adding a fine slice of melon and a large piece of
wheaten bread, of the preceding day’s baking. His wife and aged
mother, seated beside me, examined me with insatiable curiosity;
they appeared mild and timid, but nevertheless, addressed several
questions to me relative to the countries inhabited by the
christians. I observed in this room two large sacks of corn for the
family provision, some fowls, and a dog, the guard of the house: in
one corner was collected the dirt of several days’ sweeping. After
partaking of the Jew’s hospitable collation I took leave of these
good people. A negro slave had accompanied me, fearing, he said,
lest these infidels should insult me. Jacob desired me to return on
the following day, when he would change my piece of money; for, my
visit having been made on Saturday, no business could be
transacted. The Moors, inquisitive and troublesome, were far less
generous; they offered me nothing but their bad dates, and even of
these they were liberal only because they could not themselves
consume their superfluity.</p>

<p>On the 27th, I accompanied Sidi-Boubacar to a market, which is
held three times a week near a village called Boheim about three
miles N. of Ghourland: Boubacar mounted a fine mule, and myself an
ass, destined to carry the provisions on our return.</p>

<p>This market is held in a beautiful spot surrounded by
palm-trees; it contains many clay huts for the accommodation of the
dealers in stuffs, mercery, and spices, and the butchers. The
Berbers and Arabs from the adjacent villages come hither to sell
their merchandise: they bring cattle, corn, fruit, and green
vegetables, and in return purchase the stuffs of the merchants. As
I expressed a desire to take a particular survey of the market, my
companion ordered one of his people to attend me, assuring me, that
if, as a stranger, I was found there alone, the very clothes I had
on would be stolen. I was astonished at the variety of articles
exhibited in this market. I saw there great abundance of fine
herbs, cabbages, turnips, onions, peas, and dried beans, indigenous
fruits, such as raisins, white and black currants, pears, nuts
gourds, and melons of a fine sort; green lucern for the horses, and
many productions of Europe; also fowls and boiled eggs; I bought
half a dozen of the latter for the value of six farthings of our
money. I observed sheep of an astonishing size, covered with very
fine white wool.</p>

<p>Water sellers, with their full bottles, walked to and fro in the
market, with a little bell to give notice to all who wished to
drink, for the heat here is most oppressive. There is no scarcity
of wells in the market, but they are very deep, and as strangers
have not ropes to reach them, much water is sold, though it is
rather brackish. I beheld asses and mules laden with the
productions of nature and industry arriving from all quarters, and
might easily have fancied myself transported into a well stocked
European market. I bought some figs and raisins for my refreshment,
together with a small wheaten loaf worth a sous. The Jews are the
principal brokers: there are merchants established here who
purchase from individuals the woollen goods manufactured at home,
store them, and export them to other markets. No money is current
here, except that of Morocco and Spain; the coin of other European
countries is taken by weight. After traversing the great desert,
almost deprived of the necessaries of life, the pleasure which I
experienced in contemplating a market so richly furnished is
indescribable, but I was obliged to return to the village with the
slave to whose care Sidi-Boubacar had consigned me, and this man,
when his purchases were completed, was unwilling to stay any
longer.</p>

<p>On the 28th, Sidi-Boubacar, who was become much attached to me,
sent me an invitation to his house, where he waited to receive me.
He seated me on a fine carpet, spread in the court, under a little
shed, and then requesting me to wait a moment, he went for a friend
of his, a Moor of distinction. Soon afterwards a slave brought,
upon a very clear copper waiter, a meat pasty fried in butter, and
a fine slice of melon, bought on the preceding day at the market of
Boheim: Sidi-Boubacar broke the pasty and his friend and I as well
as himself did justice to it. In the evening Jacob the Jew changed
my shilling, which enabled me on the succeeding days to buy a
little bread. The same day, being at the mosque, a Moor, whose
father was recently dead, accosted me, and, slipping an eightpenny
piece into the pocket of my coussabe, begged me to accept it for
the love of God and the Prophet.</p>

<p>On the 29th, Haggi-Le-Mekke gave me notice that I must hold
myself in readiness to set out for Fez. Unable, from the state of
my health, to undertake so long a journey on foot, I made inquiries
concerning the means of riding; I was in fact swelled and weak. I
was asked if I had dragmes sufficient to pay for a mule: I could
have done so, but thinking it not prudent to confess it, I
preferred pleading poverty, and hoped that the sale of my two blue
pagnes of Soudan would produce enough. Three days previously I had
confided them to a son of my host’s for the purpose of sale, but I
was now advised to carry them to the market of Boheim, whence the
caravan was to set out; I repaired thither with the intention of
seeing the bacha or governor, to ask assistance from him.</p>

<p>On quitting Ghourland, I was accompanied by a muleteer mounted
upon an ass; this man was charged by Haggi-Le-Mekke to conduct me
to Sidi-Habib-Benani, who resided at Boheim and was chief of the
caravan going to Fez, to whom he gave me particular
recommendations. On the road I was stopped by the Berbers going to
the market, who, perceiving that I was a stranger, surrounded me to
the number of twenty or thirty, saying all together, “Who are you?
Whither are you going?” They all pulled me by my dress and gave me
no time to answer: at length they carried off my pagne and would
have stolen my bag also, had I not on setting out intrusted it to
my guide, who, mounted upon an ass, with a Berber behind him, had
gone on before me, without troubling himself whether I was able to
follow or not. The thieves, not content with my pagne, were about
to take my coussabe also, when Haggi-Lemedan, (my guide,) to whom
the Moors of his acquaintance had given notice of my situation,
returned at full gallop with his Berber; and the latter made the
plunderers restore all they had stolen from me. Soon after this
vexatious accident, we reached the market, which I found as well
supplied as the first time I visited it. On the road I had met two
mounted Berbers pursuing at full speed, with loaded guns, two Arab
horsemen, who were galloping off with the utmost precipitation.
When the market was over, I went, accompanied by my guide, to
Sidi-Habib-Benani’s, who sent me to take a lodging in the loft of
the mosque; about ten in the evening he supplied me with a very
good couscous.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 30th of July, I seated myself modestly on
the ground at my host’s door, being well aware that he would not
have the complaisance to send my breakfast to this public lodging;
as soon as he perceived me at prayers with my chaplet in my hand,
he sent me some wheaten gruel but without dates. At ten o’clock, I
requested a Moor to conduct me to the residence of
Sidi-Habib-Bacha, at the small town of Ressant, two gun-shots north
of Boheim. This man obligingly complied, and we set out; but we
learned on arrival that the Bacha, who was indisposed, would not
come thither that day, and that he seemed to intend spending it at
his private house at Sosso, a village situated about a mile and a
half S. E. of Boheim. As I expressed a strong desire to repair
thither, my honest Moor procured a man of the village, in the
service of the Bacha, to accompany me to the latter. On my arrival
I was conducted through a large court, tolerably clean, into
another and smaller one, at the gate of which two sentinels were
sitting upon the ground, with their muskets resting against a wall.
My arrival was announced to the Bacha, who gave orders for my being
shewn in I found this Arab grandee seated, without ostentation, on
a mat, upon the ground, under a shed, near the wells, which
diffused a pleasant coolness. There were two Moors in attendance,
playing as it were, the part of courtiers. The Bacha gave me a
favourable reception and inquired the cause which had brought me
into his presence. I shortly recapitulated to him the various
circumstances which had occasioned me to take so long and arduous a
journey across the Soudan and the desert; informing him that I was
from Alexandria, whither I was anxious to return, but that from
poverty I had no means of conveyance thither; and being in
ill-health in consequence of the fatigues, which I had undergone, I
could not travel so great a distance on foot. Amongst the numerous
questions which he put to me, he asked how I had defrayed the
expenses of my route since I had quitted the negro countries: to
which I replied, flattering Musulman generosity, that every one had
contributed a small donation to the relief of my wants. He
afterwards turned the conversation to the Europeans, ridiculing
their faith. One of his Moors, a very corpulent man, hereupon
sneeringly observed, “Why, as Jesus is the Son of God, did he
suffer himself to be crucified by the Jews?” As this question was
pointed at me, I replied, that I was in no way concerned to support
a cause the merits of which I did not understand, and that the
Christians must discuss his objection. The Bacha then sent for his
steward and commanded him to give me some dates, which were brought
in a small straw basket, but of which I declined eating though I
was politely pressed. By order of this chief, I was reconducted by
one of his sentinels to my host at Boheim, with an invitation to
repeat my visit on the following day at his government residence;
he also sent instructions to Sidi-Mohammed, the sherif who had
accompanied me in the morning, to repair thither with me.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 31st, I did not fail to wait with the
sherif for the Bacha, on his road to the town. We stood up
immediately upon perceiving him. He rode a fine grey horse, and was
escorted by two soldiers, each armed with a musket. He halted for a
moment before us: the sherif, in accosting him, respectfully kissed
his white tunic; the Bacha spoke a few words to him in a low tone,
after which, raising his voice a little, he informed me that I must
remain at Ghourland till further orders, I readily concluded that I
had nothing to hope from his highness; and, returning to my
village, Mohammed confirmed me in my opinion. Sidi-Habib-Benani had
set out in the morning for Fez; having refused to give me a mule or
any other conveyance for three mitkhals of silver, the produce of
the sale of my two pagnes: thus I found myself at Boheim, without
knowing how to leave it. I had a very good coussabe, which
Abdallah-Chebir had given me at Timbuctoo; and I determined, at the
risk of going away without clothing, to sell it in the market, and
endeavour to hire an ass, so that I might be able to set out the
day after the morrow with a caravan going to Fez: the eldest son of
Benani, a merchant by profession, sold my coussabe for two
mitkhals, which, with the three others, sufficed to hire an ass. At
ten at night, I went as usual to present myself at the gate of my
host’s son, from whom, during the day, I had received as a present
some bread and a bunch of grapes: he also sent me a supper and I
went to bed under the sacred roof of the mosque. The court of this
structure was locked and the inmates could not open it during the
night; a circumstance which had nearly drawn me into grievous
trouble. This court enclosed the tomb of a holy sherif, long since
deceased: the following morning, my fellow-lodgers were scandalized
to perceive that this revered sepulchre had been soiled during the
night; a universal cry of indignation arose, and all eyes were
turned upon me. Amazed and confounded, I had not courage to assert
my innocence; my only excuse was ignorance of the localities, and I
protested, with perfect truth, that the profanation was not wilful
but purely accidental. This sincere allegation was, however, far
from calming the tumult, and I know not how serious the
consequences might have been, had not some old men fortunately
determined to intercede in my favour. They represented that my
situation as a stranger should be taken into consideration; that I
was undoubtedly ignorant of the existence of a tomb in this place;
but that, supposing me even acquainted with the fact, it was
impossible I could have learned amongst christians to respect that
which is the object of homage to all good Musulmans; that some
indulgence should, therefore, be shewn to my want of knowledge.
This plea made an impression and the matter dropped.</p>

<p>On the 1st of August, I repaired in the morning to the gate of
my host to seek my breakfast; but I waited till two in the
afternoon without obtaining any thing. At this time several Moors
were collected and beginning to question me; but I told them that I
was suffering too much from hunger to be in a condition to answer
them, having eaten nothing the whole day. A zealous Musulman
offered to give me a loaf for the love of God, if I would accept
it; and I was too much famished to refuse it, hard as it was.</p>

<p>On the 2nd; the caravan prepared to depart for Fez; the man
whose ass I had hired had received my earnest, and I waited for him
in the village where he had engaged to take me up. Before taking
leave of this country I will give a succinct description of it.</p>

surrounded with various coloured Dutch tiles, symmetrically
arranged in a diamond pattern.</p>

<p>The villages of Ghourland, L’Eksebi, Sosso, and Boheim, in the
same line, all S. E. of Ressant, are pretty near each other: those
which I have had an opportunity of examining, are nearly of equal
size, and contain about eleven or twelve hundred inhabitants, all
land-holders or merchants. The soil of Tafilet is level, composed
of sand of an ash grey, and very productive; much corn, and all
sorts of European fruits and vegetables, are cultivated here;
lucern thrives well, and when dry is stored for winter
provender.</p>

<p>The natives have fine sheep, with remarkably white wool; they
use it in making very handsome wrappers, which are woven by the
women. They have also some horned cattle, though fewer than the
roving tribes, excellent horses, some asses, and many good mules.
The horses are for the most part the property of the Berbers, who
are very numerously established in Tafilet, but less addicted to
pillage than those of el-Drah, and indeed formidable to strangers
alone.</p>

<p>This country is in general very agreeable: its inhabitants carry
on a considerable commerce with the Soudan and el-Arawan, whither
they export tobacco in leaves of their own growing, together with
European commodities; and receive in exchange gold, ivory, gum,
ostrich-feathers, dried provisions, and slaves; for, unhappily, the
infamous traffic in the latter exists in full vigour in this part
of Africa. The commodities which the merchants dispatch to
Timbuctoo, through the medium of the roving Moors of el-Harib, who
may be considered as the carriers of the Soudan, are transported on
camels to the confines of the desert by the Berbers, who deliver
them to the Moors engaged to convey them to their destination. The
Berbers receive a tribute for this service, a species of indemnity
given to them by agreement, since they do not, like the Arabs,
extend their travels through all the negro countries. If the
merchants were to neglect this prudent precaution, their caravans
would be pillaged by these barbarians, as they sometimes are by the
Touariks. I have already said that the most distinguished Moors of
Tafilet usually settle at Timbuctoo, in the hope of making a
fortune, as amongst us Europe is left for the new world: these
Moors, after devoting five or six years to commerce, purchase gold
and slaves, and return to live peaceably in their own country.</p>

<p>The soil of Tafilet is very good, and produces all the
necessaries of life. The numberless date-trees surrounding each
property furnish their owners with a plentiful subsistence and a
considerable branch of commerce. They sell a quantity of dates in
all the dependencies of Morocco, and especially in the towns
situated on the sea-coast.</p>

<p>The population of this district is divided into several classes,
and the distinction of social ranks is rigorously observed.
Labourers by the day or month are considered as belonging to the
lowest grade; those who esteem themselves of a higher order treat
them as a very inferior race of beings. There are also in Tafilet
many negro slaves, and some emancipated negroes, who, however, are
never suffered to intermarry with the Moors; even the children born
of a negress and a Moor, by a clandestine union, have no
acknowledged condition in the country, and can never emerge from
the lowest classes.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Tafilet tan a great quantity of leather; they
make excellent morocco, which is much esteemed in commerce, and
finds at Fez a ready market. The people of this country are more
industrious than I have any where remarked, in the different parts
of Africa which I have visited.</p>

<p>Every one brings to the market the fruit of his labour; there
may be seen in abundance woollen wrappers, coussabes, tanned
leather, pagnes, shoes, mats, wooden trenchers, in short all the
manufactures of the country.</p>

<p>Each proprietor is accustomed to enclose his lands either with
an earth wall or a ditch; all the villages are walled, and those I
have seen have but one gate of entrance, which is shut every
evening. The inhabitants rear much poultry, as large as ours, and
eat the eggs boiled. They have pigeons, but these birds are scarce.
Some individuals keep a dog and a cat, which live upon dates.</p>

<p>Throughout the districts of el-Drah and Tafilet are found Jews,
who inhabit the same villages with the Musulmans; they are in a
pitiable condition, wandering about almost naked, and continually
insulted by the Moors; these fanatics even beat them shamefully,
and throw stones at them as at dogs: the smallest children may
abuse them with impunity, since they dare not revenge themselves,
and cannot expect protection from authority. I have frequently been
so excited myself as to threaten these little revilers with severe
chastisement.</p>

<p>The Jews of Tafilet are excessively dirty, and always go
barefoot, perhaps to avoid the inconvenience of frequently taking
off their sandals, which they are compelled to do in passing before
a mosque or the door of a sherif. They are clothed in a shabby
coussabe, and a very dirty white cloak, of little more value, which
passes under the left arm, and is fastened over the right shoulder.
They shave their heads after the example of the Moors, but leave a
tuft of hair which falls over the forehead. Some are pedlars,
others artizans; they manufacture shoes and mats from palm-leaves;
some of them also are blacksmiths. They lend their money upon usury
to the merchants trading in the Soudan, whither they never go
themselves. Their only visible fortune consists in their houses,
but they often take lands as a guarantee for the money which they
lend. Money is always plentiful with the Jews: yet they affect the
utmost poverty; because the Moors, who ascribe to them greater
riches than they really possess, often persecute them for the
purpose of extorting their gold: besides which, they not only pay
tribute to the emperor and his agents, but are moreover harassed by
the Berbers.</p>

<p>The Jews live better than the Mahometans, couscous and gruel
forming but a small portion of their food; their bread is of wheat,
kneaded and baked by themselves and their principal beverage, beer
of their own brewing, though in the season of the vintage they make
a little wine.</p>

<p>The Jewish, as well as Moorish women, wear a piece of stuff,
twelve or fourteen feet long, about the body and thrown over the
head, and go barefoot; their costume indeed differs only in the
head-dress. They have on each side of the head a thick large tuft
of hair hanging over the shoulder, about five inches in length and
three in circumference, and they habitually cover their heads with
a piece of coloured stuff, always dirty, like the rest of their
garments.</p>

<p>The Jewesses whom I have seen in Tafilet are in general small,
lively, and pretty: they have blue eyes, animated and expressive,
aquiline nose, and a mouth of middling size; they are inquisitive,
and very fond of talking. Drawing water, washing linen, fetching
wood for cooking, in short all the household labours, fall to their
share.</p>

<p>I shall not undertake to portray the Musulman women of Tafilet;
I found it impossible to obtain a view of their faces: when out of
doors they have the appearance of an uncouth moving mass, from an
enormous woollen cloak, in which they are enveloped from head to
foot, and which scarcely allows them to see the way they are going:
it is only in the bosom of their families, and sometimes in the
inner court, that they shew themselves unveiled. Care is taken to
give the women notice to retire to their private apartments, when
strangers are about to enter the dwelling upon any business.</p>

<p>A custom prevalent in the east obtains also here and is
rigorously observed: when a common Moor passes a sherif he unties
his sandals, takes them in his hand, and makes a low and respectful
obeisance.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of August, about half past four <span class="sc2">P.
M.</span> the caravan proceeded in a N. N. E. direction. We met on
the road a vast number of Moors from the country, driving asses
loaded with all sorts of productions, as melons, grapes, figs, and
other fruit, and vegetables, going to a neighbouring market.</p>

<p>We crossed some fields, and passed near a walled village the
name of which I have forgotten: continuing our route for the space
of a mile to the N. N. E., we arrived at the village of Afilé,
without which we halted at sun-set. It is situated near a
considerable rivulet, called by the natives Sidi-Aiche, the water
of which although brackish, is their only beverage: this rivulet
runs slowly to the N. W. Plenty of barley for our beasts was
brought, soon after our arrival, and some water-melons for the
refreshment of the sherifs, of whom we had half a dozen in the
caravan travelling to Fez to sell their dates; and who were not
prevented by the insignificance of their traffic from assuming airs
of importance.</p>

<p>Towards eleven at night, several large calabashes full of
couscous, with the flesh of a kid killed for the purpose, were
brought to us from the village; the bearers carried them on their
heads, and were lighted by a taper. No sooner had these messes
arrived than the descendants of Mahomet feasted voraciously, and
gave what remained to the Moors of their train: care was taken to
awaken all who were or pretended to be asleep. I was at the moment
lying on the sand beside the baggage; and as no one seemed to pay
any attention to me, I patiently resigned myself to the loss of my
supper, although I had eaten nothing the whole day but some dates,
given to me by my host at parting. At length a Moor from the
village, walking about with his taper in his hand, discovered me,
and asking who I was, led me to an immense dish of couscous, round
which several Moors were assembled, and desired me to help myself.
The Moor who presided at the repast placed some scraps of meat upon
an old mule-cloth, and, when we had eaten the couscous, he gave to
each a little bit of the reserved meat, tearing it with his dirty
fingers.</p>

<p>On the 3rd of August, at half-past five in the morning, we again
proceeded northward, through plantations entirely surrounded with
earth walls, over which I perceived beautiful fruit trees, such as
pears, figs, apricots, vines, and some rose bushes. These charming
plains though rather deficient in moisture, often renewed the
delightful remembrance of our European gardens. The sterility of
the Sahara was still so impressed upon my imagination, that the
plains of Tafilet appeared by comparison a terrestrial
paradise.</p>

<p>About ten in the morning we passed Tanneyara, a little village,
a mile to the east of our road, shaded by immense numbers of
date-trees. Here our caravan was retarded by a troop of Arabs, to
whom we were obliged, whether we would or not, to pay the
passage-dues. This prank occasioned a great deal of confusion; the
two parties had nearly come to blows; but fortunately no bad
consequences ensued: the merchants gave a few dragmes, and the
Arabs left us to continue our route, which lay over a dry and
gravelly soil. The gently swelling hills which rose on either hand
were apparently composed of red sand, and bore no vegetation: the
heat was extreme, and we had no water to moisten our parched lips.
At one in the afternoon we reached Marca, a large village enclosed
by a wall twelve or fourteen feet high, and there halted.</p>

<p>We ran in haste to the wells, situated beyond the village, but
could not draw water enough, having unfortunately no better bucket
than an old leathern bag full of holes. My thirst being at length
satisfied, I seated myself in the shade near the gate of the
village; where many idle Moors were lying on their backs, waiting
the call to supper: immediately upon perceiving me they rose with
astonishment and asked each other, “Who is this man?” easily
detecting me for a stranger by the costume I always wore, which was
of Soudan stuff, and strikingly different from their own.</p>

<p>They assembled round me and overwhelmed me with questions. I was
never taken at first sight by the Moors of Tafilet for an Arab;
they always treated me at once as a stranger; redoubled artifice
was necessary to deceive them: but when I declared myself to have
been taken prisoner while very young by the army of Bonaparte, they
appeared satisfied, and congratulated me upon the good resolution I
had formed of returning to my country</p>

<p>At the gate of Marca, I met, by a singular accident, a Berber
whom I had known at el-Harib: he received me with kindness, and
immediately acquainted the assembly with my history. This Berber
politely invited me to visit his humble cabin, of a single floor,
where he seated me on a very clean mat, and his wife produced some
dates which we ate together. She sat unveiled in a corner of a dark
and dirty room employed in weaving a woollen wrapper. When we had
eaten our dates, the Berber led me to the mosque, and introduced me
to two sherifs, natural sons of the emperor: we found them at
prayers: but no sooner had they finished than I was persecuted with
questions; amongst others whether I had been circumcised either in
the Soudan or at Alexandria: I replied that I was circumcised in my
infancy previously to leaving my country, and I hastened to change
the topic, these interrogatories being always distressing to me
since they constrained me to repeated falsehoods. Fortunately my
reply appeared satisfactory, and I took advantage of their
discourse being directed for a moment to their pupils to leave
them; they soon, however, sought me out at the gate of the village,
where I was seated, placed themselves on the ground beside me, and
displaying a New Testament in Latin and Arabic, asked me if I knew
that book; I read a few passages to them, and they amused
themselves with ridiculing the supposed credulity of the
christians.</p>

<p>As the village was surrounded by pleasant walled gardens, I
expressed a wish to see them. The youngest of the party instantly
took me by the hand, and, followed by six other Moors, we walked to
them. The young sherif when in his garden ordered some figs and
grapes to be gathered, which he offered me very gracefully. I was
particularly surprized by an almost French politeness in his
manners; for example, never serving himself first, offering me the
finest and ripest fruits, and even peeling them for me. I ate
however but sparingly of fruit, fearing lest it might disagree with
me. I saw in this garden melons, gombos, and a great variety of
fruit-trees; it also contains a well thirty feet deep.</p>

<p>From the garden we returned to the mosque, where
Sidi-Abdoul-Rahman, (this was the name of the young sherif) ordered
one of his people to carry me some bread and honey; and desired me
to remain till supper time, as he intended to provide me with that
meal.</p>

<p>This good young man, about twenty-two years of age, favoured me
with a very obliging invitation to spend some days with him at
Marca, in order to recover from my fatigues, promising afterwards
to forward me to Fez at his own expense. I thanked him heartily,
but urged as an objection my impatience to reach home. The Berber
brought me a handsome dish of mutton couscous; and a moment
afterwards the sherif sent me a portion of his supper, and had the
further kindness to order one of his household to accompany me with
a lantern to our encampment.</p>

<p>On the 4th, at half after five in the morning, we departed,
journeying N. N. W., amongst mountains and along the banks of a
beautiful rivulet which fertilizes the neighbouring soil: the
resident proprietors understand how to avail themselves of this
resource; they form canals from it, by which they water their small
possessions; by this method they are enabled to cultivate corn and
maize in seasons of the greatest drought, and to produce abundance
of fine melons. Some palms and fig-trees grow on the margin of this
pretty rivulet; and I remarked throughout the route small
habitations scattered at very small distances. We advanced more
than two miles an hour notwithstanding the stony nature of the
soil. At half past two <span class="sc2">P. M.</span> we halted at
M-Dayara, a town defended by a high wall and encompassed by a moat
seven or eight feet in depth and of equal breadth. We entered by a
large gate and passed the night here. When the cattle were unladen
and the baggage arranged, my guide, the sherif, noble scion of the
prophet, recommended me to repair to the mosque to seek my supper:
without answering him, I remained some time seated upon a mat, near
a Moor of the town, who seeing I was in no hurry to withdraw, and
no doubt fearing the necessity of dividing his supper with me,
advised me to rejoin my companions, and take my share of the
provision which the town would provide for them. Thus repulsed on
all sides I lay down beside the baggage: my illustrious muleteer
angrily asked, why I did not remain at the mosque; to which I
replied that he might go thither himself to seek his supper; this
answer silenced him. Finding him so desirous to get rid of me, I
thought that the Moors of the caravan intended to club together to
purchase food, and determined to learn how this might be.</p>

<p>The sherif Sidi-Moula-Sitec, a man of high nobility and who
enjoyed the imperial favour, travelled along with our caravan; he
carried his wife with him, concealed under a scarlet pavilion, as
well to preserve her from the intense heat as to screen her from
our observation: at the halting-places, four persons assisted her
to alight, and one of her women, who also appeared veiled in our
presence, lifted up a corner of the curtain to admit the air.</p>

<p>Sidi-Moula-Sitec, whose provisions for himself and his suite
were separately dressed, sent in the evening a copious supply of
tea to his travelling companions; they took it while waiting the
approach of supper time; and soon afterwards an enormous dish of
couscous was sent to them, which was speedily divided among twelve
or fourteen Moors, who disputed the possession of it. When my
muleteer had satisfied his hunger, he put the two or three
mouthfuls of couscous that remained, in a small basket, generally
used for feeding his asses with barley, and brought it to me, I
eagerly accepted this food, as I had eaten nothing all day but a
few dates. After this slender repast, finding that I should not be
permitted to remain beside the baggage, I went in search of a place
where I might sleep in quiet, and lay down at the door of the
mosque, near some travelling Moors, who were so much annoyed by my
cough, for I had a severe cold, that in great anger they even
struck me, to compel me to withdraw.</p>

<p>At five in the morning, I perceived by the arrangements which
were making, that we should not set out before evening, and
determined, though with repugnance, to beg in the town for some
dates, a fruit so plentiful in this country. I first applied to an
old Moor, who affected all the externals of devotion, but he shewed
little sensibility for my misery, recommending me to trust in God
who would assist me; a second brought me a handful of rotten dates,
which I could not eat; and a third, whose mien announced more
charity, gave me a considerable quantity, but they were harder and
worse than those which I had eaten at el-Harib. Losing my
fortitude, and undeceived on the subject of Musulman charity, so
much vaunted among us, I returned to our baggage, and, presenting
my acquisition of fruit to the asses which refused it, I
breakfasted upon a handful of that which had been given me at
Boheim. Part of the day was spent in shoeing the animals.</p>

<p>About three <span class="sc2">P.M</span>, being all ready, we
took our departure, and travelled N. W., over level and stony
ground; the sun was setting as we reached Rahaba, where we encamped
under the palm-trees, without the town. As I happened to be placed
near the sherif Sidi-Moula-Sitec, who had shewn me, on the road,
the unexampled courtesy of giving me a draught from the cup which
he himself in general used, I went to thank him; he gave me a
friendly reception, and, offering me his hand with a smile, told me
that he had directed one of his suite to supply me with provisions
all the way to Fez, and, to leave me under no uneasiness on this
head, he renewed his order in my presence; but the profligate
servant took little notice, and obeyed his master’s command for one
night only.</p>

<p>On the 6th of August, at five in the morning, we continued our
route northward, at first on very level ground; after which we
reached a chain of mountains, stretching from E. N. E. to W. S. W.,
and struck into its gorges, following the course of a pretty little
rivulet called Guigo; the road being extremely stony and difficult.
About eight we passed L-Eyara, a village containing from twenty
five to thirty houses, all ill-constructed with a ground-floor
only; this village stands on a rock of black granite. Hitherto our
direction was N. N. E., here we turned due north.</p>

<p>At one <span class="sc2">P. M.</span> we halted at Tamaroc till
the heat, which was intense, should abate: I lay down upon the
grass, in the shade of a fine rose-laurel, pleasantly situated on
the margin of the rivulet, the freshness and gentle murmurs of
which inclined me to sleep. The hills on each side of the route had
no great elevation, and appeared composed of brittle and
coarse-grained rose-coloured granite, in some parts combined with
white quartz. At three <span class="sc2">P. M.</span>, the heat
having somewhat moderated, we proceeded northwards through the
defiles till half past five; we then turned to the west, still
following the sinuosities of the same rivulet. This stony road led
us into a valley, well cropped with corn and maize, the verdant
aspect of which amidst these barren mountains presented an
enchanting spectacle. About seven in the evening we halted at Kars,
where we passed the night. Between Tamaroc and this place, we saw
no more palm-trees.</p>

<p>On the 7th at five <span class="sc2">A. M.</span>, we resumed
our journey, first in a westerly, and subsequently in a northerly
direction, still threading the defiles of the mountains, through a
less fertile tract than that over which we had just passed; here
though the country is still watered by the Guigo it is generally
barren.</p>

<p>The roving Berbers, who encamp in these narrow valleys, find
here and there a little forage for their cattle. About eleven
o’clock we arrived at N-Zéland (or Ain-Zéland) our beasts being
much fatigued. The hamlet is inhabited by Berbers, who breed fine
sheep. As these people are accustomed to give nothing to the Moors,
part of our caravan were compelled to forego their supper. The
sherif Sidi-Moula-Sitec ordered a couscous, and sent a portion of
it to the sherifs of the company; the Moors of inferior rank were
not included in the distribution.</p>

<p>The Berbers, thinking to gain something by us, made cakes of
barley-meal, which they sold for a good profit to those who had
money: encouraged by the success of this traffic, they killed two
sheep, which they cooked whole at a large fire, cut up into small
pieces, and sold for four mouganans, a sum equivalent to eight sous
of our money. But our company was so numerous that this provision
proved insufficient, and those who could not obtain any ate dates
only; a poor substitute for more nourishing food.</p>

<p>On the 8th of August, at three <span class="sc2">A. M.</span>,
we quitted N-Zeland. The beast I rode being excessively fatigued, I
was compelled to perform part of this day’s journey on foot; and
still weak, I walked with difficulty over the flinty mountain
roads, pausing every moment to recover breath. I was not singular
in my misfortune, many of our people were on foot, for the poor
animals could scarcely drag themselves along. Till eight o’clock we
proceeded northward, then for one hour westward, and afterwards
turned again to the north. The road was so bad that the asses sunk
under their burdens; their haunches were galled by the friction of
a girth, which it is customary here to pass over the rump in the
fashion of a crupper, to prevent the load from slipping forward in
descending steep declivities, while another, which girds the
breast, performs the same service in ascending. The guides without
any remorse struck these poor animals severe blows to quicken their
pace. At two <span class="sc2">P. M.</span>, overcome with fatigue,
we reached L-Eksebi, where we halted: this pretty village is
encompassed by a good wall, and contains about eight hundred
inhabitants; it is situated on an extensive plain, watered by the
windings of the rivulet which I have before mentioned, and
surrounded by high mountains wholly destitute of vegetation. The
plain is well cultivated, and even embellished by some olive-trees.
On our arrival, the inhabitants, all Moors, opened a market, where
we found in abundance bread, meat, raisins, and figs, which were
all sold by weight. Near this market is a kind of caravansera,
where travellers are received on payment of a small remuneration
for the animals only; these are lodged in little galleries
constructed for the purpose, and the men sleep near them on the
ground.</p>

<p>As the dates presented to me by my host of Boheim were now
exhausted, and I had nothing whatever to eat, I determined to beg
some, not of the towns-people, for as the palm-trees do not grow in
the vicinity they are dear here, but of a young Moor of our own
caravan, who obligingly gave me some.</p>

<p>On the 9th, we set out at five in the morning, directing our
route to the north; about seven we turned to the W. N. W. ascending
hills from one hundred to one hundred and twenty-five feet above
the surface of the plain. In every direction similar eminences meet
the eye, all exhibiting, with the exception of a few cork-trees,
complete sterility. Exhausted with fatigue, I feared that it would
be impossible to continue my journey; my limbs bent under me, and I
was compelled to sit down continually; my courage was ready to
forsake me: this ascent was indeed a terrible task for my enfeebled
powers. By the blessing of God we attained the summit by nine
o’clock; and thence descended into an extensive and beautiful
plain, surrounded by high lands, which were mostly barren of
vegetation. Four times in the course of the day our caravan was
stopped by the Arabs, who had encamped by the road-side, to obtain
payment of the passage dues, which was made in dates, and bread
baked a second time in the oven; I was told that they acted under
the sultan’s orders. Some Berbers as we passed spread a pagne
beside the road, that a few dates might be thrown to them: this
fruit is scarce and dear in this part of the country; and some of
them brought us water in exchange. About three o’clock we arrived
at L-Guim, a small Moorish village, where some cultivation is
visible and some forage may be obtained, but the general aspect of
the country is sterile and dry; not a single tree is to be seen. I
supped upon some pieces of barley bread, baked a second time, and
which I steeped in a little water. This bread Sidi-Moula-Sitec had
sent me as a present, the evening before, by one of his servants.
After this repast I lay down near a field of maize, making my
pillow upon a ridge between its furrows.</p>

<p>At five in the morning of the 10th, we set out again, our route
lying W. N. W.; at seven we turned to the north through defiles of
arid and stony mountains; at ten to the N. N. W. The landscape,
interspersed with lofty eminences, has a most dreary appearance; on
some of them only grows a quantity of box to the height of about
eighteen inches, the leaves of which were dry and yellow. In the
level parts we saw some Arab tents from which at our approach the
children issued to beg dates. About three <span class="sc2">P.
M.</span> we reached Guigo, a small Berber village: its environs
are naked, without any trace of cultivation, and the wells are so
distant, that it is not easy to procure water without paying in
dates, of which I had no more, and was obliged to have recourse to
charity for a draught; I applied to several Moors, who all repulsed
me like a dog, and bade me slake my thirst at the fountain.</p>

<p>The heat, which had been intense, moderated towards evening;
just before our arrival a slight thunder-shower fell, which
continued for a quarter of an hour, and greatly cooled the
atmosphere. A sherif, who had long suffered from a bad foot, gave
me some water and a small cake of wheat and aniseed, on condition
that I should furnish him with a remedy; I had still a little
diachylon left, and divided it with him; he then opened before me
several rags, in which his foot was wrapped, and I saw two large
white maggots upon the nearly healed wound.</p>

<p>On the 11th, at three <span class="sc2">A. M.</span> we quitted
Guigo, journeying north upon a very stony road: many shrubs,
however, flourish in this country; wild roses and mulberry-trees,
the hawthorn, olive-tree, dwarf oak, and others, are watered by the
current of a meandering rivulet,<a id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> in the transparent and
delicious waters of which we found relief from our thirst. About
two <span class="sc2">P. M.</span> we arrived at Soforo, a walled
town, situated in a fine and extensive plain, very stony but
fertile; maize and the olive are cultivated in this tract. The
approach to the town is ornamented by pretty gardens enclosed by
quickset hedges, and abounding in fruit-trees, round which creep in
great numbers vines loaded with fine grapes. We alighted at a
fandac.<a id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class=
"fnanchor">[20]</a> I walked through this town which is the finest
that I had hitherto seen. It contains a handsome mosque, built of
brick and plastered with mortar; two fountains appropriated to the
purpose of the Mahometan ablutions conduce to its decoration. Two
watermills are the most remarkable objects in Soforo. The houses
are chiefly built of brick and of one story. The streets are narrow
and dirty, nevertheless the vicinity of several brooks which rise
in the mountains, and the many pretty gardens of the suburbs render
this town an agreeable abode. A market is held here daily, which
attracts many strangers, and in which the Jews have shops. Baked
meat is sold in it, and remarkably fine melons. A clumsy clock in
the mosque tower excited my surprise.</p>

<p>In the evening, Moula-Sitec employed a Jew merchant to purchase
some wax candles for him; the poor Jew on his return was stopped by
a sherif, who, detaining him by his cloak, demanded one of them. In
vain he protested with an air of supplication, that he had no means
of making such a present, the Moor vehemently insisted, and,
seizing the Israelite by a lock of his hair, drew his poniard with
an apparent intention of killing him; quaking with fear the poor
wretch cried out with all his might, “Oh! spare me, my lord, for
the love of God.” The Moor at length released him, and the Jew ran
off at his utmost speed.</p>

<p>Moula-Sitec called me to his presence, and inquired, as though
he doubted my sincerity, whether I loved the Musulmans; he then
made me recite some verses of the Koran, and at length informed me
that on the following day we should reach Fez, which town is
sometimes visited by christians.</p>

<p>About nine in the evening, great bowls of couscous were served
for supper. The sherifs, being persons of high distinction, ate
first, and sent us the remainder.</p>

<p>On the 12th of August, at five <span class="sc2">A. M.</span> we
quitted Soforo, and again observed in its outskirts a long line of
pleasing gardens: the road, shaded by trellises of fig-trees, is
paved with flints to the distance of nearly three or four miles
from the town. As we gaily pursued our route northwards, we fell in
with many Jews proceeding to the market of Fez, which place we also
reached about noon. The road had been good, less stony than that we
had previously traversed; but the ground was little cultivated.</p>

<p>Having neither acquaintance nor letters of recommendation, I
took up my lodging with my muleteer at the fandac. After a short
repose upon a mat, I was desirous of visiting the market. To reach
it I passed through several dirty narrow streets of low buildings.
The market is held in a street under a roof of trellis-work and
straw; the dealers occupy little shops, five or six feet square,
raised about three feet above the surface of the ground. Men keep
these shops and sit there the whole day in the fashion of tailors
on their board. No one took notice of me, and I bought for three
felouses<a id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class=
"fnanchor">[21]</a> a small loaf and a few grapes upon which I
dined; then returning to the fandac I passed the night there with
the asses and mules.</p>

<p>On the 13th, I went with a negro of Mequinaz to visit the upper
part of the town; this good-natured man took pleasure in shewing me
its curiosities. We inspected several mosques: one in particular
attracted my attention as the finest; it is called by the Moors
Mouladrib.</p>

<p>Wishing to proceed as soon as possible, risked changing two
English crowns, in order to hire a mule to carry me to Rabat, where
I hoped to find a French Consul. I applied first to a Moorish
merchant, who bore the character of being very devout; he weighed
my pieces and offered much less than their value; I was refusing to
part with them on such terms when a Jew blacksmith passed us, and
the Moor proposed to him to purchase them. Notwithstanding the bad
character of his race, he proved less usurious than the Musulman.
After weighing the crowns in scales which he always carried about
him, he offered me a price much above that of the zealous follower
of Mahomet; I therefore treated with him: but having at the moment
no money at hand, to avoid detaining me he requested the Moor to
pay me the price agreed upon. The latter hastened to comply, but
gave me coin which would not pass without a diminution of one
fourth of its value. Such is the charity of these avaricious
hypocrites, who abuse with impunity the ignorance and simplicity of
an unfortunate stranger.</p>

<p>The Moors all questioned me incessantly upon my travels; they
pitied my sufferings, but not one of them invited me to eat; they
gave me no other consolation than the assurance that God would not
abandon me, but that it would please him to restore me to my
country and my friends.</p>

<p>On the 14th, fearing that a longer residence in Fez would be
injurious to my health, I made preparations for removing to
Mequinaz: this, it was observed, was not the road to Algiers, but I
was unwilling to increase my distance from Rabat and Tangier, and
reported my intention in going to Mequinaz to be to throw myself at
the feet of the Emperor, and make known to him my miserable
situation; not doubting that his compassion would furnish me with
the means of proceeding to Algiers, whence I should more easily
obtain a passage to Alexandria. The importance of this application
to the sultan being obvious, no farther observations were made on
my project. I was happy in finding so satisfactory a pretence for
approaching the sea coast, but internally resolved to avoid the
Emperor as solicitously as I affected to seek him.</p>

<p>Fez is the finest town I have seen in Africa; I shall endeavour
to describe it as minutely as the shortness of my stay there will
permit.</p>

<p>El-Fez, so called by its inhabitants, but designated on the maps
by the name of Fez, is a large city belonging to the empire of
Morocco, of which it was formerly the capital. It is situated in a
species of natural tunnel formed by lofty well-wooded mountains,
whence spring several considerable rivulets, which, after
fertilizing the valley, supply the city with excellent water. Every
mosque contains <i>jets d’eau</i>, and in several streets there are
fountains for the refreshment of the thirsty passenger: here are
also several water-mills for grinding corn. The city extends from
east to west and must be about four miles in circumference, as far
as I could judge from a survey of it from the top of a hill. It is
surrounded by a double brick wall, about twelve or thirteen feet
high, well constructed and ornamented at intervals with raised
copings. I was astonished by the regular architecture of a spacious
gateway, in the form of a triumphal arch, through which the city is
entered. Under this arch were established a number of venders of
provisions.</p>

<p>Within the compass of the outer wall are some gardens, and small
low houses, called the suburbs; here I observed some manufactories
of Delft ware and tiles. The houses have terraced roofs like those
of Timbuctoo, and are built of bricks perfectly well formed and
baked in a kiln. Their masonry is not very correct: small, square
and strongly grated windows overlook the streets; and the outsides,
which are lime-washed, are much out of repair; they have generally
a story above the ground-floor, which receives air and light only
from an inner court.</p>

<p>The streets are paved, but narrow, winding, dark, and dirty to
the last degree; I saw in some places, dogs and cats which had been
long dead and emitted a pestilential stench.</p>

<p>These streets are nothing more than galleries covered by
trellises or masonry, which deprive them of a free circulation of
air, concentrate all the disagreeable effluvia of the city, and
render it very unwholesome.</p>

<p>The principal manufactures of Fez are blankets and gunpowder;
ploughs and wooden spades are also made there, and the city
contains locksmiths, cutlers, shoemakers, tailors, masons,
blacksmiths, who likewise act as farriers, and gunsmiths, but the
fabrication of their guns falls far short of the perfection of
ours.</p>

<p>Shops may be found in most quarters of the town furnished with
all sorts of provisions, dried or otherwise; as bread, meat,
butter, pastry, fruit, and vegetables. As there are no inns,
travellers without acquaintance in the city have no other resource
than to buy what they want at these shops, and to carry it to the
mosque or to the fandac to eat.</p>

<p>A market is held every day; it is attended by a great concourse
of strangers, who come from great distances to sell their
commodities: great quantities of dates and tanned leather are
brought to this market from Tafilet; the inhabitants of the
mountains supply it with honey and wax, of which last candles are
made, not only for home consumption, but for large consignments to
the principal maritime towns.</p>

<p>For the security of the shops, dogs are every night turned loose
into the streets of the market; these animals, trained for the
purpose, perform their duty so zealously, that, but for the
interference of men who sleep near, they would inevitably devour
such passengers as chance or business attract to the spot confided
to their charge.</p>

<p>No monument of departed splendour exists at Fez to awaken
curiosity or recal the former magnificence of the conquerors of
Spain: but it boasts of many mosques, each surmounted by a square
tower of about a hundred feet in height, upon which a white flag is
hoisted as the signal for prayer. I visited several of them,
accompanied by the good-natured negro of Mequinaz; and found them
large edifices of an oblong square form, containing several
galleries raised upon well-built arcades. The only one which
appeared to merit particular attention is called by the Moors
Mouladrib, probably from the name of its founder. It is the chief
ornament of the city. The interior is preserved with the utmost
care; it is paved with small pieces of well varnished Dutch tiles,
of various colours and shapes, tastefully arranged in mosaic; and
the whole compass of the walls, to the height of two feet and a
half, is inlaid in the same manner. The arches which support the
roof are of far superior workmanship to those of the other mosques;
two of them are raised on finely sculptured marble columns, the
other pillars are of brick, covered with plaster. The vaulted
ceiling is composed of boards, painted yellow and red, and adorned
by a broad band of gold colour forming the cornice. Within a sort
of sanctuary, in the middle of the mosque, stands a small altar,
covered with a cloth embroidered with flowers in gold; and around
it are placed several glass lamps and flambeaux, and near it is a
handsome lustre hanging from a gilt cupola; a multitude of
suspended lamps are also dispersed throughout the temple, to
enlighten the faithful. The thirsty traveller is refreshed by a
very beautiful fountain which plays in an inner court and invites
numbers to sleep within its cooling influence.</p>

<p>Neither inns nor hotels are to be found in Fez; their place is
supplied only by fandacs similar to those which I have already
described. Here travellers who possess beasts of burden are obliged
to sleep on the ground beside them, and themselves to provide them
with forage. They usually take their meals at the mosque, pass the
greater part of the day there, and would sleep there if permitted.
The proprietors of the fandacs exact six felouses per head for the
cattle, a sum equivalent to two French sous.</p>

<p>Two hills, which command the city are defended each by an
insignificant fortress, having embrasures but no cannon: one is
situated nearly S. E., and the other, in which some prisoners were
confined, is to the N. W.</p>

<p>The immediate environs, for two or three miles round, are highly
cultivated, and produce abundance of vines, and olive, fig, apple
and pear trees; near the wall are mulberry-trees of considerable
height. I have seen flower-gardeners selling in the markets a great
variety of flowers, similar to those which adorn our parterres in
France. At some distance from the town are a great number of little
mausoleums, in which the remains of the most distinguished sherifs
are deposited.</p>

<p>Fez is computed to contain about twenty thousand inhabitants,
all either artificers or traders, who carry on an extensive
commerce in European manufactures, which they export to Tafilet and
Timbuctoo as well as to the adjacent mountainous countries.</p>

<p>The 14th of August, at seven in the morning, I quitted the
fandac and walked through the city with my leathern bag thrown over
my shoulder. A long street conducted me to the western gate, where
I hired a mule to carry me to Mequinaz; and, our provision for the
journey being prepared, we departed, directing our course W. N. W.,
over a smooth soil composed of very good mould but uncultivated. I
remarked several tents of wandering Arabs pitched beside a little
river formed by the junction of the rivulets which water the
environs of Fez. Our road, which was very uneven, lay between two
ridges of barren hills, and crossed several well constructed
bridges.</p>

<p>About two o’clock we rested under a bridge which sheltered us
from the sun. We had in our company two women who, being under no
restraint, shewed but little solicitude to conceal their fair
complexions and pretty faces beneath their veils; one of them rode
on my mule behind me; and I presume that my attentions were
agreeable to her, as she offered me a slice of melon and a bit of
bread which I accepted with pleasure. Our pretty fellow-travellers,
however, learning that the Emperor had set out for Rabat, returned
to Fez, and I continued my route with my guide alone; our mules
keeping up so good a pace that I estimated our progress at four
miles an hour.</p>

<p>At five in the morning we arrived at Mequinaz, the streets of
which city were as dirty and narrow as those of Fez; and, entering
a fandac, I begged to be allowed to sleep in a stable, a favour
which the master refused in the rudest manner. Turning from a place
which offered so little hospitality to an unfortunate stranger, I
sought refuge in the mosque, the asylum of the indigent: there I
hoped to repose in peace till the morning; but alas! I was
disappointed. About ten at night an old bamâb (porter) came to me,
and kicking me, roughly desired me in a hoarse voice to rise and
begone, for he was about to shut up. In vain I represented myself
as a stranger not knowing whither to go, and implored him to allow
me to pass the night in this retreat: without the least regard to
my situation he compelled me to leave the mosque. Such conduct
ought not to have surprised me, for in this part of Africa, as in
some other more civilized countries, men are distinguished only by
their apparel, and it must be confessed that mine did not plead in
my favour; but I considered that it would be highly imprudent to
study my dress: my rags excited no attention, and this livery of
poverty served as a veil with which prudence required that I should
still envelop myself.</p>

<p>I possessed some pieces of silver and four buckles made of gold
from the mines of Bouré; but, as it would have been dangerous to
shew them, I took my bag upon my shoulder, and left the mosque,
uncertain where to find repose for my sick and wearied frame. For a
short time I wandered about the streets meditating on my forlorn
condition, and, oppressed by the recollection of the humiliations,
fatigues, and privations which I had already endured, and by the
chilling sense of those which I still experienced, I could not
altogether suppress my tears. Let me hope this weakness was
excusable in my disastrous situation: it was within sight of the
desired haven that I was most in danger of shipwreck. With a heart
sinking under these reflections, I sought shelter in the shop of a
dealer in vegetables, who, taking me at first for a Berber, would
not suffer my intrusion; when, however, I told him that I was an
Arab, he left me in tranquillity to pass the night on the ground.
Laying my head on the leather bag which contained my notes, I
enjoyed a short forgetfulness of misery, but was soon awakened by
the cold, and sleep solaced me no more during the night.</p>

<p>August the 15th, at six in the morning, hastily quitting this
inhospitable place, I resumed my journey towards Rabat on foot,
carrying my bag, and but scantily provided with food.</p>

<p>Beyond the town I passed some gardens, and several plots of well
cultivated hemp. I soon discovered that it would be impossible for
me to reach Rabat on foot, for my limbs had scarcely strength to
support me, and the pain which I felt in the spleen was aggravated
by fatigue. Resting therefore for a moment against a wall I
considered how I should proceed, and finally determined upon
returning to the town. Taking my purse out of my bag, and observing
with sorrow that its contents were much diminished, I was
nevertheless under the necessity of abstracting a few shillings
from what remained, proposing to change them on my return to
Mequinaz, to procure me a conveyance. Inadvertently I laid my knife
and pocket-compass on the ground beside me and forgot them. Much
grieved by their loss, I returned from the city to seek them, but
unhappily in vain. As I again approached the city I saw several
Spaniards, who had been shipwrecked on the coast, followed by a
crowd of Moors, and escorted by soldiers, armed with sticks for the
purpose of preventing the pressure of the crowd; they were being
conducted to the Emperor, and I remarked with pleasure that they
were not ill-treated. A Jew, who spoke the Spanish language acted
as their interpreter. I followed them a short distance, but,
finding it impossible to penetrate to them, returned towards the
market, and seated myself at the door of a Berber, who, perceiving
that I was suffering pain, asked me who I was and what ailed me: I
told him my story, which, like all his countrymen, he believed.
Having imparted to him my intention of hiring a conveyance to
Rabat, in the hope of seeing the Emperor and applying to him for
assistance to enable me to return to my own country, this good
Berber induced me to place my bag in his shop and promised himself
to negociate with the muleteer for the fulfilment of my wishes.</p>

<p>In the course of the day, I visited the fandacs, and there met
with a man from Tafilet, who proposed to me to hire an ass for my
conveyance to Rabat. I took him to the Berber, and, having agreed
upon the price, which was fixed at a piastre and three quarters, I
paid him the earnest; we were to set out the following day. In the
evening I bought some fruit and bread for my guide and myself.</p>

<p>On the 16th of August, at six in the morning, I mounted my ass,
not without the assistance of my guide, which on account of my
weakness I was unable to dispense with: we travelled due north for
about an hour, then turned N. W. till nine in the morning. The
route is interrupted by hills, and turns a little to the south.
About two o’clock we halted under the shade of a zizyphus lotus, to
repose during the extreme heat: at three we resumed our route to
the north, till half-past four, and then proceeded N. W. On the
road we met a traveller in the utmost distress on account of the
death of his horse, for, besides the inconvenience of prosecuting
his journey on foot, the poor man was compelled also to carry his
saddle to some inhabited place; my guide took pity upon him and
placed his saddle behind me, which suited me well, for I was so
weak that I could scarcely sit up, and this saddle made a
convenient support for my back.</p>

<p>At six in the evening, we reached a considerable brook, which
runs S. S. W., and afterwards west, and stopped to slake our thirst
at it. I had been suffering from fever nearly the whole day, and
the heat had been overpowering; I now lay down to take a short
repose. During this halt, the Moor, who was not the owner of the
horse he had lost, obtained from a sherif a certificate of its
death: the sherif, having interrogated me in common with the other
witnesses of the event, gave on our evidence the writing which
testified that the horse had died without any fault on the part of
its rider.</p>

<p>At sun-set, after having eaten some figs given us by the
Berbers, we proceeded northwards till eight o’clock, when we
reached a camp, provided with a tent that served as a mosque, and
was destined also for the reception of travellers; we took up our
quarters in it, and the inhabitants of the camp brought us supper.
This spot is covered with prickly shrubs.</p>

<p>At two o’clock in the morning of the 17th, we quitted this
hospitable camp; for half an hour we were followed by a troop of
nearly thirty dogs, which barked incessantly, and even bit our
beasts. At five o’clock, turning to the N. W. we proceeded over
level ground covered with a fine vegetation. Towards eight in the
morning, we halted for an hour beside a well, where we breakfasted
upon fresh bread, and some water-melons which we had found in the
fields. After this rural repast we drank some pretty good water,
which we were able to take up by hand, the wells being shallow. We
continued our route to the N. W., and at eleven o’clock, the heat
being violent, again halted under a beautiful clump of fig-trees,
where several travellers were sleeping; we rested till noon, my
guide, who was sufficiently complaisant, having some consideration
for my illness. After this short repose we proceeded still towards
the N. W. till three <span class="sc2">P. M.</span> when our
direction turned E. S. E.; we now journeyed over loose sand. At
half-past two we stopped before a camp of soldiers, who were on
their march to rejoin the emperor; they had pitched their tents
near an arm of the sea, which my guide told me was called
Sbo.<a id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class=
"fnanchor">[22]</a> To my great surprise tolerable order was
preserved in this camp: the centinels were placed at equal
distances from each other, but they slept the whole night; the
chiefs were lodged in handsome tents, having a centinel at the
door, and soldiers around them. The women of the neighbouring
districts supplied them with bread.</p>

<p>On the 18th, at three in the morning, we set forward, crossing
the camp, where the soldiers were still all asleep; but one, waking
up with a start, exclaimed: “Who goes there?” This did not however
interrupt our progress. Farther on we encountered the advanced
guard, also asleep, but our noise disturbed them, and waking up
they inquired who we were and whither we were going: upon receiving
our answer they permitted us to pass through the midst of them, for
there was no other road, and it was necessary to cross a bridge. We
proceeded by a fine road to the S. W.; the soil composed of grey
sand is naturally fertile. At eight in the morning we halted to
take a slight repast of bread and some nuts purchased at Mequinaz,
and ate it in peace beside a well. We continued our route to the S.
W. over a soil similar to that which I noticed over-night, and
arrived at an arm of the sea on the opposite shore of which Rabat
is situated; here I saw several Portuguese vessels. The vine
flourishes in the environs of this town, and the fields are well
cultivated.</p>

<p>Upon entering Rabat, I proceeded with my guide to the fandac,
where I rested awhile and then set out to walk through the town in
hopes of finding the French consul, for I concluded that there
would be one here. I held some shillings in my hand, by means of
which I proposed without committing myself to find the consular
house. I begged several Moors to change them for me, knowing that
they would not (for they have little complaisance) but I foresaw
that they would refer me to a christian, to whom I hoped by this
innocent stratagem to be enabled to speak without exciting
suspicion. In fact, the first Moor whom I requested to change my
shillings for the coin of the country directed me to the
christians; I took advantage of this circumstance to inquire for
the French consul, saying, that the money was French, and he,
having no suspicion of me, immediately pointed out the consul’s
residence. I knocked at the door, and was thrilled with joy at the
thought of being about to see a Frenchman.</p>

<p>A Jew, who spoke tolerable English, opened the door; he told me
that the consul was at this moment with the sultan, but that he
would soon return. I retired for a short time, and on my second
application was by the same Jew presented to the French consul at
Rabat. Gracious God! how was I disconcerted, when I found that he
was himself a Jew! I was so thunderstruck that I remained for a
moment speechless; meanwhile he addressed me in pretty good French,
inquiring what I wanted with him: recovering a little from my
stupefying surprise, I shewed him my shillings and begged him to
change them; an English merchant who chanced to be with him, and to
whom I confided my secret, assured me that I might safely
communicate to the Jew the true cause of my application to him. I
then told the consular agent that I wished to converse with him for
a moment in private, upon which he shewed me into his warehouse and
seated me upon the floor. There I informed him that I was a
Frenchman, that I came from the Soudan, and that, desiring to
return to my own country, I claimed the protection due to a subject
of the King of France. The Jew asked if I had any papers, and if I
was travelling by order of the government: having satisfied him on
all these points, he opened a French book of geography, and pointed
out upon a map the Senegal and other districts, no doubt to display
his learning: he then shewed a letter from M. Sourdeau,
consul-general of the King of France, announcing his nomination to
the dignity of consular agent at Rabat; but he gave me to
understand that he received no pay, and that in consequence I was
not to expect much assistance from him; then dismissing me, he
recommended me strongly not to make myself known if I valued my
head; for, added he, the Moors are no triflers on the subject of
religion.</p>

<p>I then returned to the fandac, leaving with the consular agent
ten shillings, which he refused to change; he gave me however on
account, three dragmes (twenty four sous) for the supply of my most
urgent wants during the following days. I made my guide purchase a
piece of roasted mutton and two small loaves, which I divided with
him; resolving however that this should be my last repast in his
company: not that he had been deficient in complaisance to me, but,
convinced that I must be extremely desirous of an interview with
the sultan his master, he was perpetually endeavouring to pursuade
me to solicit one. I had exhausted all my pretences for delaying
this step; and had sufficient reason to beware of presenting myself
before the African monarch, who, more suspicious than his subjects,
would in all probability have proved more clear-sighted.</p>

<p>I quitted the fandac therefore, and passed the day at the corner
of a street; where I hoped to spend the night with equal
tranquillity, and lying down enveloped myself in my large wrapper.
I was invoking sleep, the friend of the unfortunate, when a dozen
dogs began to bark furiously at me, and I should certainly have
fallen a prey to these animals, had I not been promptly assisted by
one of those men, who are posted in the streets at night expressly
to rescue passengers from their attacks. This man inquired who I
was; “I am an Arab, a stranger here,” replied I, “on my return to
Alexandria my native country.” Upon this he placed me in a small
recess near which he slept himself; arming me with a strong bamboo
cane to drive away the dogs, if they should trouble me again; a
very judicious precaution, for these creatures, apparently
conscious that I was a stranger, never ceased throughout the night
annoying me with their menacing cries. I would gladly have slept at
a fandac, but for the expense of three paras per night, and the
risk of insults from the muleteers. Consulting my poverty, and
uncertain when I should be able to obtain assistance from the
French Consul, I determined to be as saving as possible and to
sleep under the canopy of heaven. Henceforth, I sought repose in a
cemetery, situated to the west of the town on the sea-shore, where,
peacefully extended at the foot of a mausoleum, I was neither
tormented by men nor dogs. During the day I remained at the corners
of the streets, sometimes repairing to the mosques to take my
melancholy meals, consisting of a little bread and a bunch of
grapes, to which I occasionally ventured to add from my scanty
resources a small piece of fried fish. As the wells of Rabat are
brackish, I was obliged to beg water from the Moors who seldom
refused me. Such was the kind of life which I led, during the whole
of my residence at Rabat, while waiting for an opportunity to
proceed to Tangier to the French Consul. I now and then saw Ismael,
the Jew agent of the consulate, who gave me some small coins of the
country, on the security of the ten shillings with which I had
entrusted him. One day, finding him at home at breakfast, I was
invited to sit upon the floor and partake of his tea. I entreated
him to procure for me some means of travelling to Tangier;
promising to reimburse him as soon as I should reach the consul;
but the Jew, fearing no doubt that this would be disapproved by his
superior, drily refused. Seeing that nothing was to be gained from
this man, not even permission to embark on board a Portuguese brig,
bound for Gibraltar, I was about to write to M. Sourdeau,
Consul-general at Morocco, when Ismael received a letter from
Tangier informing him of this gentleman’s death; I therefore
addressed myself to the Vice-Consul M. Delaporte, on whom the
direction of the consulate had devolved; but an opportunity of
going to Tangier occurring during the interval, while I awaited his
answer, I hired an ass to carry me thither, for my legs would no
longer support me.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of September, I quitted Rabat with the owner my ass,
the most worthless man I had met with in this country. The poor
beast destined to carry me, was already oppressed by a heavy
burthen, and sunk at every step up to his knees in the loose sand
of the sea-shore; I had therefore no alternative but to dismount,
and though I had paid a good price for my conveyance, and was
scarcely able to drag myself along, was obliged to perform half the
journey on foot, while my unworthy guide rode forward with the
utmost indifference. On reaching the place appointed for the halt,
I threw myself down under a tree, and wrapped up in my old blanket,
suffered there a violent attack of fever, produced by fatigue and
exhaustion. Towards seven in the evening, my guide brought me a
handful of couscous, which had been given him by some Arabs near
whom we had encamped.</p>

<p>At Larache I saw two vessels cruising, and little thought that
one of them would shortly bear me from this frightful country. I
ascended with difficulty the hills in the vicinity of Tangier, and
at length, ill, and worn out with fatigue, I arrived in that town
on the 7th of September, at nightfall.</p>

<p>As I entered on foot the centinel took no notice of me, and I
thus fortunately escaped an explanation with the governor of the
town, which might have thrown some obstacles in the way of my
departure, or even have involved me in destruction. I deposited my
bag at the fandac, and the same evening explored the town in search
of the French Consulate. I saw many flag-staves, but could not for
the darkness distinguish that of my own nation. The moment was most
critical. I dared not to address myself to a Musulman, who would
infallibly have asked what concern I had with the christians: and
if my intentions had been discovered I should have lost all hope of
restoration to my country. I lay at the fandac, and passed the
night in extreme agitation. In the morning I again repaired to the
street where I had seen the flags, and perceived an open door, near
which stood a christian; looking carefully round, to ascertain that
I was not observed, I accosted him in English, inquiring for the
residence of the British Consul. “This is it,” replied he; but,
fearful of attracting notice, by conversing too long outside the
door, I would have entered the house, to ask a direction to the
French Consulate; but this man, who I supposed was a domestic,
repulsed me with horror, on account of my dirty and disfigured
appearance. I inquired for the residence of the French Consul, and
he bluntly answered, “He is dead,” but at the same time called a
Jew, who directed me to the door of the Vice-Consul, and with an
air of curiosity, asked who I was, and what I wanted with a
Christian; I retreated without answering, trembling with the dread
of detection. When all whose observation I had excited had passed
on, I returned to the Vice-Consul’s door, which, being opened, I
entered the house: a Jewess called M. Delaporte who received me
with the greatest kindness, and conducted me up stairs to an
apartment where I was entirely concealed from view. I comprehended
the full extent of the danger which surrounded me, from the fear
which M. Delaporte expressed of the difficulties which must
embarrass my departure from this country; but, speedily laying
aside any uneasiness relative to my present situation, he gave free
vent to the joy with which my almost miraculous escape from the
dangers of so arduous a journey inspired him, and in his transports
even embraced me, pressing me closely to his arms, notwithstanding
the dirty rags in which I was clad: I cannot indeed speak too
warmly of the benevolent reception which I experienced from this
generous man. After enjoying a breakfast from his hospitality I
found myself, with great regret, obliged to depart, though we had
not yet determined on any means for rescuing me from my present
embarrassing situation. No sooner had I set foot in the street than
I most inconveniently encountered my muleteer, who, seeing me come
out of a house, inquired where I had been; at first I felt a little
confused, but quickly recovering I told him that a charitable
priest had given me a breakfast in that house. I returned to the
fandac, and did not leave it again that day, apprehensive of
exciting attention, as those by whom I had been seen had inquired
whether I was a renegado.</p>

<p>I passed the night in contriving means to obtain another
interview with the Vice-Consul In the morning the master of the
fandac came to demand three felusses for my night’s lodging in his
stable, and then, pushing me by the shoulders, sent me to return
thanks to God and the Prophet.</p>

<p>At nightfall I again presented myself at M. Delaporte’s house:
as I was entering, the female servant, not recognizing me, ran back
uttering a loud cry; this brought from the street the Vice-Consul’s
guard who, precipitately entering the house, put his hand upon my
shoulder, and demanded who I was, and what I wanted. I was
completely disconcerted,. M. Delaporte, being brought down by the
noise, knew me, but affected great anger, and spoke very harshly to
prevent suspicion. “Turn out this dog of a beggar,” said he, “what
can he want here? begone!” The soldier still asking what I wanted,
I examined the house as though in doubt; and saying, “What! does
not Sidi-Mohammed reside here? I fear I have made a mistake,” I
retired; the soldier following me a short distance, but by favour
of the night I easily escaped him. On my return to the fandac I
threw myself upon the ground, to recover from the emotion which
this untoward accident had occasioned. After an hour’s repose, I
again repaired to the street where M. Delaporte resided, hoping
that he would send some one to me with a message of encouragement;
but I saw no one. I passed another agitated night, sleeping little;
and at day-break took my station in front of the Vice-Consul’s
house to seek a decisive interview with him, the suspense in which
I continued having become insupportable. I seated myself at the
door of a poor shoemaker, to watch the moment when I might enter
the house without observation. The Jewish maid servant, who had
been so unfortunately alarmed the preceding evening, recognized me:
and, having given notice to M. Delaporte, made me a sign to come
in. The Vice-Consul obligingly expressed his regret for the
unpleasant scene of the preceding evening; he did not dissemble his
apprehensions for me, in case I continued long in my present
situation, but could devise no means for my escape; I was still
more perplexed, as without his assistance I should find it
impossible to quit the country. Seeing me resolved to extricate
myself as speedily as possible from this state of distress and
anxiety, M. Delaporte fixed an hour of the night for my return to
the consulate, to quit it no more till I should be enabled to
embark for Europe. I spent the remainder of the day at the fandac,
and that my sudden disappearance might occasion no surprise amongst
its inmates, I apprised them that I intended to proceed to Taone on
my route to Algiers. When it was quite dark, I rolled my bag in my
wrapper to screen it from observation, and repaired to the
appointed spot, where I immediately saw M. Delaporte and a Jew, who
came to conduct me to my destined asylum. I was admitted to the
Consular residence by a back door, and led to a good chamber, where
M. Delaporte presently sent me a European dress, for which I gladly
exchanged the dirty rags I had so long worn: he then visited me in
my new apartment, and expressed the greatest satisfaction at seeing
me in a place of safety.</p>

<p>After returning thanks to Almighty God, I lay down upon a good
bed, rejoicing in my escape from the society of men debased by
ignorance and fanaticism. Though all my wants were relieved, I
found it impossible to close my eyes the whole night, so much was I
agitated by the remembrance of the perils I had passed through.
During my whole residence at the Consulate, M. Delaporte came many
times each day to see and converse with me; he treated me as his
own son, and indeed lavished on me all the cares of the tenderest
father.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to describe my sensations on casting off
for ever my Arab costume; I retraced in my memory all the
privations and fatigues I had endured, and the length of route I
had traversed in a wild country, amidst a thousand dangers. I
blessed God for my arrival in port; but I believed myself in a
dream, and asked if it was indeed true that I might soon be
restored to my country, or whether this enchanting hope was but a
delusion.</p>

<p>M. Delaporte neglected nothing that could contribute to the
re-establishment of my impaired health, and the wholesome
nourishment he gave me effected a decided improvement; but I was
still frequently attacked by paroxysms of fever which kept me in a
state of extreme weakness. During my abode in the consulate I was
occupied in arranging my notes.</p>

<p>Besides the frequent and agreeable visits of the Vice-Consul, I
received also those of a Jew domestic to whom the secret of my
seclusion was confided: this man, though a Frenchman, was
thoroughly imbued with the principles of his race and had no ideas
but for the advancement of his interests. He undoubtedly believed
that my views were the same, and advised me to carry the fruits of
my travels to England; representing to me that this nation had
offered a reward of twenty-five thousand pounds sterling for the
accomplishment of the journey to Timbuctoo. Instead of listening to
so contemptible a proposition, I replied, that I was a Frenchman,
and added: “The recompence to be derived from the French government
would undoubtedly be less considerable; but I should not hesitate a
single moment to offer to my native country and my king the homage
of my modest labours.”</p>

<p>The excellent M. Delaporte wrote very pressingly to the
commander of the French station off Cadiz, describing in lively
colours the dangers to which I was exposed by a longer residence in
this place. The commander, determined by his solicitations, sent
one of the king’s sloops to Tangier to convey me to Toulon.</p>

<p>On the 27th of September 1828, a little before sunset, a
sailor’s dress was sent me as a more convenient disguise. A Moor
inquired who I was, saying that he had not seen me disembark with
the others; the Jew, who attended me, answered that I was a
Frenchman from Tetuan, returning to France, and the Moor made no
farther remark. I embarked on board the sloop <i>La Légère</i>,
suffering much from fever, and the Commander Jolivet supplied me
with every thing necessary in my situation.</p>

<p>On the 28th, at six in the morning, we set sail with a fair
wind, and to my great satisfaction soon lost sight of Tangier. M.
Jolivet’s cares had a beneficial effect upon my health; the fever
left me, and the fine sea-breezes soon completed my recovery. We
arrived at Toulon after a very favourable voyage of ten days.</p>

<p>Those who have been long absent from their native land, and have
good cause to fear that they may never return, can alone form an
idea of my sensations on my restoration to my beloved country.
While in quarantine I wrote to M. Jomard, President of the central
commission of the Geographical Society, to announce my travels to
him. I soon after received, as the first proof of the benevolent
interest of this learned association, the sum of five hundred
francs, to defray the expenses of my journey to Paris: nor was it
long before I enjoyed the glorious reward of its merited
approbation. The society applauded my zeal, and awarded to me the
recompense promised to the first traveller who should penetrate to
the mysterious town of Timbuctoo, and bring from thence his
authentic observations. The government graciously received the
Society’s report upon my travels, and soon bestowed upon me
distinguished marks of its munificence and honourable
protection.</p>

<p>But this flattering success raised adversaries against me: some
alleged that I had never reached Timbuctoo; others, that I had been
shipwrecked on the coast of Barbary, and, having obtained
possession of some vague intelligence respecting the interior of
the country, had imposed it upon the public for the results of my
personal observations. I have been even accused of changing my
religion <i>at every station</i>. To this malevolent imputation, I
answer: that I externally adopted the forms of the Mahometan
worship as the only means of penetrating into the countries through
which I have travelled—an achievement which, without this
acquiescence, would have been impracticable, except by encountering
at every step the hazard of death, and inevitably suffering it at
last. I must confess that these unjust attacks have affected me
more sensibly than all the hardships, fatigues, and privations,
which I have encountered in the interior of Africa.</p>

<p class="center">GENERAL RETROSPECT OF THE PUBLISHED INFORMATION
ON THIS SUBJECT PRIOR TO M. CAILLIÉ’S TRAVELS.</p>

<p>A powerful interest is attached to travels in central Africa:
any attempt, therefore, to explore this part of the world can
scarcely fail to excite curiosity, provided, at least, that it
makes some addition to the knowledge previously acquired and
supplies one of the deficiencies of geographical science; that is
to say, if it furnishes authentic documents concerning the
respective situations of places, their topographical positions, and
relative distances; concerning the natural productions and physical
geography of the country; the population, commerce, interior
navigation, industry, and agriculture; the manners, customs,
religious worship, superstitions, and language of the people, or
the physical conformation of the inhabitants; in short, provided it
is calculated to interest the geographer or the naturalist, the
historian or the person engaged in commerce and manufactures. The
merit and usefulness, indeed, of a narrative of travels consists in
these positive results. The attentive reader will discover in the
simple journal before him more than one such result, especially in
matters of geography, the nomenclature and position of places, the
course and importance of rivers, the situation of mountains, and
generally speaking, every thing relating to the accidents of the
soil. The various tribes, also, visited by M. Caillié, and in the
midst of which he lived, presented so many subjects of observation
that it was impossible he should not attempt, at least, to sketch
their portraits. To the well-informed public it belongs to
appreciate whatever is new and interesting in this simple and
inartificial picture of nations and tribes scarcely known in
Europe, even by name. I must not, however, rest here, but will turn
my undivided attention in the first place to examining and
discussing all the points of geography connected with M. Caillié’s
route. Before I proceed, to this discussion, for which I shall need
all the indulgence of the reader, I shall take leave to cast a
glance upon the explorers who preceded him, and the information we
possessed anterior to his travels. Notwithstanding the advantage
which M. Caillié has over all his predecessors, in having brought
to Europe a description of the city of Timbuctoo, written on the
spot, several motives induce me to recapitulate here the prior
attempts which have been made by others, each of which enterprises
has formed an additional step in the career which he alone has been
enabled to pursue to its accomplishment. After this examination of
the discoveries and relations of preceding travellers, I shall
analyse the map of the route annexed to this work. It has been
constructed from the materials furnished in minute detail by the
journal of the French traveller, and which also form the basis of
the general map of the journey. I shall then treat of the
nomenclature of the countries through which he has travelled, of
the course of the great river, which, like Mungo Park, he has
navigated, and of the acquisitions for which science is indebted to
him, without neglecting the questions connected with the theatre of
his discoveries.</p>

<p>Whoever studies the history of the discoveries in the interior
of Africa is obliged to go back to the learned cosmographer
el-Edricy, who may be styled the Prince of Arabian geography. Till
now, an extract only of his description has been known, but a
learned oriental scholar<a id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> has just discovered a much
more complete manuscript than that which was translated into Latin
at the commencement of the 16th century, and which the learned
Hartmann has commented upon. While waiting for the benefit of the
translation preparing by M. Amédée Jaubert, I shall quote from the
Latin version<a id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class=
"fnanchor">[24]</a> the description of the countries which M.
Caillié has visited, but which form only a very small portion of
the theatre of his peregrinations. According to el-Edricy,
Segelmassa or Sidjilmessa, a town in the country of Tafilet, is
forty days’ journey from the Soudan, that is to say, from the
inhabited districts and fertile soil of this immense region; it is
also computed to be forty days’ journey to Tocrur or Takrour, to
Salla or Sala, and to Ouhl. Sala is on the northern and Takrour on
the southern bank of a river called Nile. Sala is two days’ journey
from Takrour whether by land or water.</p>

<p>The place named Oulil, described as an island properly so
called, is the great mart for salt in those parts, and is situated
sixteen days’ journey from Sala. Eastward of Takrour are several
large towns; Ghana, at a distance of twenty four days, and Berissa
of twelve; from the latter Aoudeghest<a id=
"FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
is twelve days’ journey towards the north and the district of
Lamlem six to the south; this contains Wangara, Maleb, and Dau,
four days’ journey from each other; to the west is Meczara, to the
east, Vancara, to the north Ghana, and a desert to the south.</p>

<p>Many of these statements agree sufficiently with M. Caillié’s
marches across the desert; I can here only slightly mention this
conformity, because it would be necessary otherwise to enter into
details on the extent of a day’s journey and on the different kinds
of days’ journeys; an important question which shall be discussed
elsewhere. Takrour corresponds perhaps with the locality which has
since become the seat of Timbuctoo<a id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>: the importance of this
ancient town is proved by the name of Takrour, then given to the
whole of the Soudan, and applied to it by the natives even to the
present time. Sala is a point known to M. Caillié, but to the right
of the route from Timbuctoo to Tafilet, and not to the west of
Timbuctoo; and it must not be confounded with Ain-Salak, the oasis
of Agably.</p>

<p>May not the Oulil of el-Edricy, so long sought, be an island in
the sense understood by the word oasis, as surrounded on all sides
by an ocean of sand? this place would then correspond well with
Tychyt, celebrated for its salt-mines; it is true however that the
Arabian geographer seems to place Oulil upon the sea itself.<a id=
"FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class=
"fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>With respect to Ghana, which is thought to answer to Kano,
visited by the last English travellers, its position in el-Edricy
appears too much towards the west; unless these travellers (as has
been already suspected) have placed Kano and other points of the
Soudan between Bornou and Saccatoo, too far to the east.</p>

<p>Above two centuries before el-Edricy, Ebn-Haukal, another not
less esteemed Arabian writer, had fixed the relative positions of
Sidjilmassa, Oulil, and Ghana; these equally agree with the
itinerary of our traveller; every well informed reader will inquire
whether the same agreement exists with the marches of the
celebrated Ben-Batouta. His travels are known by the fragments
which Messrs. Kosegarten and Burckhardt have translated from the
extract given by el-Bilouni.<a id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>It is known that, in 1352, Ben-Batouta quitted Sidjilmessa for
Timbuctoo and central Africa: in twenty-five days he reached the
salt mines of Teghazza;<a id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> ten days afterwards,
Tas-hal; ten or twelve days farther on Aboulaten (Ejulat or
Eiwelaten);<a id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class=
"fnanchor">[30]</a> beyond that, Maly, at a distance of twenty-four
days; from Maly to Zaghary (or Sagher), ten days; and thence to
Karsendjou (or Karseckou).</p>

<p>This place is washed by the great river, <i>which is the
Nile</i>, and runs to Kabera and Zaghah (or Sagha); from Zaghah,
the Nile flows towards Timbuctoo, Koukou (Kok), Mouly the last
place of the country of Maly and Bowy (or Youy), one of the largest
towns of the Soudan. Thence the Nile descends to the country of
Nouba and passes Dongolah. From Karsendjou, Ben-Batouta proceeded
to the river of Sansarah, ten miles from Maly, which he left after
a residence of two months; some days afterwards he reached
Timbuctoo <i>on the Nile</i>, Koukou, Berdammah, and Takadda (or
Nekda). On his return to Sidjilmessa, he visited Touat, Kahor,
Dekha, and Bouda; a journey of more than twenty-eight days or
stages.</p>

<p>The obscurity of this recital must be confessed: it arises
chiefly from the different ways of reading proper names, in
supplying the orthographical signs often wanting in manuscripts.
Thus Burckhardt has read تغاري Tegherry, the same name which
Kosegarten had read تغازا Taghazza, which would bring the traveller
into the country of Fez very far from the Sahara. Tas-hala, a
commercial town is perhaps Tychyt: Aboulaten ابولاتن is confounded
with Eyoulaten ايولاتن or Oualet. Maly or Mala ماي is perhaps Sala
سالي, Nekda نكدا for Tagada تكدا &amp;c.</p>

<p>The places in the neighbourhood of Timbuctoo, according to
Ben-Batouta, are Kabera and Zaghah. We still know Cabra, and the
second of these names reminds us of the Meczara of el-Edricy, and
the Mar-Zaghah or Marzarah of other accounts. Thus the distance of
the places with which M. Caillié became acquainted, and which in
consequence I have placed upon the general map of the Travels,
Tychyt, Oualet, Sala, Cabra, and Timbuctoo, would nearly agree with
the description of Ben-Batouta: I say nothing here respecting the
direction of the rivers.</p>

<p>Few itinerary distances are to be found in the relations
compiled from the discoveries of the Portuguese on this coast of
Africa. They have carefully concealed the positive documents which
they may have collected, lest the other nations of Europe should
rival them in their commerce. We read in the Decades of Barros that
they had much intercourse with the two kingdoms of Toucourof and
Timbuctoo. It is not demonstrated that the first of these names is
identical with Takrour,<a id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> and consequently this
passage will not prove that the countries of Takrour and Timbuctoo
are distinct.</p>

<p>In the time of Leo Africanus, who travelled in the early part of
the sixteenth century, the prosperity of Timbuctoo had declined in
favour of the town of Djenné, which is still, by the report of M.
Caillié, more considerable and commercial than the former city.
According to Leo, the river which runs near Timbuctoo takes a
westerly direction. “We navigated,” says he, “coming from the
kingdom of Tombuto, <i>to the east</i>, and following the course of
the stream, towards the kingdom of Ghinea, and as far as the
kingdom of Melli, which are both to the west of Tombo.” This
assertion is not confirmed by the French traveller. Even if we
suppose that one of the two branches, which he saw near that city
was a tributary, and not a derivative branch, and that he had not
perceived the distinction, (which must appear very extraordinary),
this hypothesis would be contradicted, since it was reported to him
by the inhabitants that this arm rejoined the principal stream at
some distance.</p>

<p>With the exception of Leo, (who was a Moor born at Grenada), and
the Portuguese, concerning whom we have but uncertain accounts,
transmitted by Marmol and Barros, the first European who reached
Timbuctoo was Francis Paul Imbert, born at Sables-d’Olonne, in the
native province of Réné Caillié; his journey was anterior to the
year 1670. He accompanied his master, a Portuguese renegado, sent
to Timbuctoo by the governor of Tafilet. From the little that is
known of his travels, we learn that the distance from Morocco to
Timbuctoo is four hundred leagues, and that it is considered a two
months’ journey. This route was nearly the same as that followed by
M. Caillié, at least as far as Tafilet: the time also is the same.
Again, the calculation of four hundred leagues agrees very well
with that of M. Caillié. Three other routes have been attempted by
Europeans for penetrating to the centre of Northern Africa; that of
the Senegambia, that of Tripoli, and that of Egypt and the Upper
Nile. The first is certainly the shortest; the second is full of
obstacles; and the last, though the longest, will probably be one
day preferred by the intelligent traveller, as the most
instructive, the most fruitful in discoveries, and for other
reasons. I say nothing of a fourth course, that of the Gulph of
Benin, which at this time engages the attention of England, but
which, notwithstanding the numerous rivers terminating in that
part, seems to offer very little prospect of success. To penetrate
into the interior by the Rivers of Senegal, Gambia, or
Sierra-Leone, was the most natural enterprize, not only on account
of the proximity, but also with a view to the necessity of tracing
to its source that vast stream which runs near Timbuctoo: a
question of no less importance than the problem of the sources of
the Nile, and, which is become almost as celebrated with the
moderns, as the other was amongst the ancients. It is also
observable that of forty-two European travellers, twenty-two are
supposed to have taken this route, independently of six Europeans
shipwrecked on that coast, carried into the interior by the Moors,
and who have collected information respecting either Timbuctoo or
other central countries. These travellers not having for the most
part pursued the same track with M. Caillié, and an abridged
history of their discoveries having been already compiled by M.
Walckenaer and other learned geographers, I consider it altogether
superfluous to review them. The reader will have double cause to
rejoice in the curtailment of these observations, and in being at
the same time directed to such excellent sources of information. I
shall only state from these various authorities, the epoch and
extent of the principal journeys, succinctly analyzing those which
present a line of route crossed by that of M. Caillié, or which
have something in common with it. The reader will thus have before
him a striking picture of the several efforts made, with admirable
perseverance, by Europeans, during the last two centuries and a
half.</p>

<p>To this list may be added Ledyard and Lucas, in 1788, Nicholls,
in 1805, Seetzen and Tuckey, in 1816, and P. Rouzée, in 1817, who
took different routes, and did not succeed in penetrating into the
interior.</p>

<p>Twenty-five Englishmen figure in this list, with fourteen
Frenchmen, two Americans, and one German: but there are few of
them, alas! since Major Houghton, who have not fallen victims to
their heroic devotion, in the midst of their career.</p>

<p>Before setting out on his great journey M. Caillié had visited
the interior of the deserts frequented by the Brakna and Dowich
Moors; he had also accompanied M. Adrien Partarrieu, attached to
the expedition of Major Gray.</p>

<p>He then followed or traversed the route of Major Houghton, going
to the Ludamar of Mungo Park, (or rather the country of
Eli-Oud-Amar<a id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class=
"fnanchor">[32]</a>) and those of Major Gray and Surgeon Dochard,
the one to Falimé, the other to Yamina. But, as he kept no regular
notes of his peregrinations in this portion of Africa, I have no
means of comparing them with those of the three former travellers.
It is otherwise with the routes of Watt and Winterbottom, who in
1794 arrived at Timbo and Labé by the Rio-Nuñez; there they learnt
that a four months’ journey would lead them to Timbuctoo, by way of
Belia, Bouria, Manda, Sego, Sousundou and Genati<a id=
"FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class=
"fnanchor">[33]</a>.</p>

<p>On examining the general map of M. Caillié’s travels Baleya,
Bourré, Amana, Sego, Sansanding and Djenné, names very little
differing from the former, will actually be found, in a line, not
indeed perfectly direct, from Labé to Timbuctoo. With regard to the
four months’ distance, it is worthy of remark that M. Caillié was a
hundred and seven days proceeding from Teleouel (nearly opposite to
Labé) to Timbuctoo, following a rather more easterly course. In
several other particulars the narratives of the two English
travellers are in accordance with the observations of M. Caillié,
such as the traffic in salt, and its being carried on men’s
shoulders, the position of Labé and Timbo with respect to
Kakondy,<a id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class=
"fnanchor">[34]</a> the state of agriculture, and the manners of
the Foulahs.</p>

<p>The first journey of Mungo Park, in 1795, conducted him to Sego
on the Dhioliba, and thence to Silla: these two places were left to
the west of M. Caillié’s route, as may be seen on the general map.
The only doubtful question respecting the line between them arises
from the considerable difference that exists as to the distance of
that line from the ocean: but this question is very comprehensive,
and embraces too many different points to be examined here. It may,
however, be observed that the population assigned by Mr. Park to
Sego (thirty thousand) appears somewhat large as compared with that
of Jenné, Timbuctoo, and other towns visited by M. Caillié.</p>

<p>In his second journey, in 1805, Mungo Park reached the river at
Bamakou; at Sansanding he embarked upon it, in a canoe constructed
under his direction, and followed it to Cabra, Houssa, and Boussa.
Thus, from the branch which runs into it below Jenné to Cabra, the
two travellers followed the same route, and navigated the same
stream. Unfortunately Park’s narrative breaks off at Sansanding, on
the 10th of November, at the moment of his leaving that town. There
is however, a last piece of authentic information on the 19th of
November; this is a note addressed by Mungo Park to his wife. It is
known that the bark which he contrived for descending the river was
a sort of raft or flat boat, formed of two old canoes.</p>

<p>It cannot easily be credited that the traveller advanced upon
the river at the rate of six or seven miles an hour as his journal
indicates: it has been seen that the direct progress of M. Caillié
on the Dhioliba was scarcely more than two miles an hour; in a
different season it is true, and at low water. Mungo Park,
according to his guide, perished at Boussa, four months after his
departure from Sansanding, which account, unless erroneous would
infer a stay either at Timbuctoo, Houssa, or Yaour.<a id=
"FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
It is not possible here to institute any comparison between the two
narratives, and I think it superfluous to seek other points of
resemblance; I confine myself therefore to the observation, that
the map of Park’s second journey aggravates the error committed in
the first map, in placing the course of the Dhioliba too far
eastward of the city of Timbuctoo.<a id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> It is not consistent with
my subject to enter into further particulars concerning that
unfortunate expedition, with the commencement and issue of which
every one is acquainted; but of the most essential points of which
all are equally ignorant, namely the navigation of the river above
and below Timbuctoo, and all those observations that were
undoubtedly made and written by the celebrated traveller on papers,
that there is yet some hope of discovering.</p>

<p>Chronological order obliges me to pass from such a man as Mungo
Park to the American sailor Robert Adams.<a id=
"FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
Notwithstanding the efforts of M. Dupuis, editor of Adams’s
narrative, and the real merit of the notes appended to it by that
learned writer, the general opinion of geographers is opposed to
the authenticity of these travels; and it is a remarkable fact,
that it is least credited in his own country. Critical observations
on this subject have appeared in the North American Review, from
which we are compelled to conclude that the original declaration
made at Cadiz by Adams before the American consul, totally differs
from his recital, made in London, to M. Dupuis. I am far from
believing in the reality of Adams’s travels in all their
circumstances as described; but a comparison of them with those of
M. Caillié belongs to my subject. Robert Adams was wrecked on the
coast of Cape Blanco, and was carried to Timbuctoo, where he says
he remained five months.<a id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> He afterwards returned
through Toudeyni, Oulad-Deleym, el-Thabla, Ouad-Noun, Mogador, Fez,
Mequinaz, and Tangier. Even in his description of Timbuctoo, a
striking contradiction occurs. “The city,” he says, “is in a very
level plain;” and yet two miles beyond the city, runs the river
Marzarah, between two rather high mountains. This river flows to
the south west, and is three quarters of a mile wide. He repeats
elsewhere that there are mountains to the south of Timbuctoo, and
says that sulphur is found there. None of these circumstances have
been noticed by M. Caillié, who walked from Cabra to Timbuctoo, and
who in thirteen days had abundant leisure to observe them. The city
appeared to Adams as extensive, without being as populous, as
Lisbon; but between two hundred and sixty thousand inhabitants and
ten or twelve thousand there is a great difference. There are no
mosques, says he, in Timbuctoo; M. Caillié saw three large and
several smaller ones.<a id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39"
class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>Adams asserts that he saw a palace built of clay mixed with
herbage, and other houses of wood or earth: the greater part of the
houses, according to M. Caillié are of brick, and the king’s
palace<a id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class=
"fnanchor">[40]</a> is nothing more than a small and extremely
simple house.</p>

<p>Adams asserts that <i>the men are tattooed</i>; M. Caillié says
nothing of the existence of such a custom at Timbuctoo: that
<i>there is not a man capable of writing</i>; the new account
frequently affirms the contrary: that <i>many elephants are to be
seen there</i>; M. Caillié scarcely saw traces of one during the
whole course of his travels. Nevertheless these differences which
may be partly attributed to his ignorance, as well as to a want of
memory, are not sufficient motives for absolutely denying the
journey of Adams, or rejecting all the information which he
procured. The same may be said of the words of the language spoken
at Timbuctoo, which Robert Adams has given to the number of
sixteen, eight of which are common to the Kissour vocabulary of M.
Caillié,<a id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class=
"fnanchor">[41]</a> but totally differing from them.</p>

<p>Was it easy, in a country where so many different languages and
dialects are spoken, to ascertain the genuine words of the
Timbuctoo idiom? The words published by well informed travellers,
such as Lyon, Bowdich and others, do not agree better with those
collected by M. Caillié. If Adams really visited Timbuctoo, it is
possible that he may have interrogated strangers instead of
natives.<a id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class=
"fnanchor">[42]</a> Major Denham alone till the present day has
learnt the true words of this language. Other features again of
Adams’s descriptions are confirmed by certain Arabian travellers
and geographers, even what he says of the river flowing in the
neighbourhood of Timbuctoo. Yet, supposing him to have seen the
river, which is to the south, may he not have been mistaken as to
the direction of the stream? May it not be the second branch of the
river, which M. Caillié saw at Cabra, and which at first runs
towards the north-east? It does not however run two miles south of
Timbuctoo, but five miles. The river, he says, is called Marzarah:
and this name though unknown to M. Caillié, yet exists; and is the
name also of a district cited above, after el-Edricy.<a id=
"FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class=
"fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>Robert Adams is not incorrect in his journeys beyond Timbuctoo:
1st from this city towards the E. N. E., as far as the river
mentioned above, where he arrives after ten days’ journey; 2ndly
from this point to Toudeyni, twelve or thirteen days’ journey N. N.
W. These distances and bearings agree tolerably well with M.
Caillié’s route from Timbuctoo to Telig.</p>

<p>Riley, the American, also wrecked on the west coast of Africa,
and detained in slavery by the Moorish Chief Sidi-Hamet, gathered
from the latter some correct notions relating to the city of
Timbuctoo. According to him <i>a small river</i> (it was then dry)
runs near the walls of Timbuctoo, and a large river flows to the
east at an hour’s distance <i>on horseback</i>. This is undoubtedly
the same with that of which he elsewhere speaks as the Zolibib,
which is two hours’ march to the south. The city is five times as
large as Soueyrah, situated in a vast plain, and built of stone,
earth, and reeds. On leaving Timbuctoo, Sidi-Hamet travelled
fifty-five days towards the N. E., and eighteen to the north,
before he arrived at Touat, and afterwards he proceeded to Fez. M.
Caillié did not perceive the little river close under the walls of
Timbuctoo; but what is said by Riley shews that it might be dried
up. The great river at two hours’ distance to the south, is
evidently the Cabra branch, flowing between the east and north. The
word Zolibib is unquestionably the same as Dhioliba. The situation
of the oasis of Agably (or of Touat), is not consistent with the
data by which I was guided in drawing up the general map, namely
the astronomical observations made by Major Laing at
Ain-salah.<a id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class=
"fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>We have seen above that Major Peddie and Captain Campbell took
the way of the Rio-Nuñez, to penetrate into the interior: the
second alone was able to advance to within a short distance of
Timbo; but he could not reach that place. Both swelled the list of
victims to the climate and martyrs of science. Captain Campbell,
and M. Caillié, as well as Watt and Winterbottom, travelled in
nearly parallel lines: their accounts, far from contradicting,
mutually confirm each other; but the marches of the French
traveller present a multitude of instructive details, and local
circumstances which the others had not the opportunity of
observing. The rivers and rivulets crossed by these travellers,
some of which flow northwards and fall into the Rio-Nuñez, and
others south towards the district of Sousou, are distinguished. By
combining the observations of all the four a complete idea may be
formed of the tract which separates Kakondy from the Fouta-Dhialon
and the mountains of Timbo.<a id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>We are indebted to the expedition of M. Mollien for some
interesting particulars of the unknown parts of the Senegambia, and
of the plain of the Fouta-Dhialon. Nothing was wanting to this
expedition of discovery but mathematical observations, which it
would be unjust to require from him who traverses, for the first
time, unknown countries, inhabited by a fanatical population.
Geography is a great gainer when it can obtain any positive
information, either respecting the lines travelled over, with their
bearings, or the relative situation of places, and their
nomenclature; or even a view of the importance and population of
the country, and the state of agriculture, commerce and industry. A
learned geographer, M. Eyriés, has shewn the merit of M. Mollien’s
travels, and the acquisitions for which science is indebted to him;
it only remains therefore, for me to notice that part of his
journey, which coincides with that of M. Caillié. Both crossed the
Fouta-Dhialon, but in different directions. The first went from
Labé to Timbo; the second passed between those two towns. Their
lines of route intersected each other at a point nearer to Timbo
than to Labé, but where there is no village; at least the list
given by M. Mollien does not present, at the point of meeting which
results from the construction of the two routes, any name in common
with the much more extended list of M. Caillié. But the latter, in
giving the position of Labé with regard to Teleouel, and that of
Timbo with regard to Dité, will be found to agree with the
itinerary of M. Mollien. In the list of the latter, we find indeed
Cambaya and Bandeia; but Bandeia, placed far north of Labé, is a
totally different place from Bandeya, which is south west of it.
The same may be observed of Cambaya to the north and near Labé,
while the Cambaya of M. Caillié lies south-east of that place, and
at a considerable distance. The description of the mountains, the
cataracts or falls of rivers, the physical aspect of places amid
those lofty mountains, (which in some respects may be called the
<i>Central Alps</i> of Northern Africa), are features common to
both narratives.<a id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46"
class="fnanchor">[46]</a> This spot, as will be seen farther on, is
a line of division between immense streams which flow from it in
every direction. There is no less analogy between the observations
of the two travellers respecting the Foulahs, the Mandingoes, and
the various tribes inhabiting those countries.<a id=
"FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class=
"fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>I now come to a traveller whose recent loss is regretted
throughout Europe, the unfortunate Major Laing. A first journey
made him advantageously known to the friends of science; a second
rendered him illustrious; and both are more closely connected with
that of M. Caillié than all the expeditions I have just reviewed.
It is fortunate for the French traveller, that he has these points
of contact with Major Laing, especially since their discoveries
upon comparison appear in perfect accordance. No one is ignorant
that, in 1822, Major Laing, after having explored the Timmanie, the
Kouranko, and the Soulimana, determined the situation of Timbo and
Falaba, the sources of the Mongo and the Rokelle, and penetrated
nearly to the source of the Dhioliba, or at least but a short
distance from that point so long sought after. He assigned the
position and elevation above the level of the sea of Mount Loma,
whence this great river takes its rise; and he marked on his map
the first part of its course northwards, to the extent of about
twenty-five leagues. Amongst these observations are two which serve
to verify those of the French traveller: the situation of Timbo and
that of the Dhioliba. Now this confirmation, as a single glance at
the general map of the travels will shew, leaves nothing to be
desired. I placed Timbo there from the documents of the Major, and
M. Caillié’s route perfectly coincides. The French traveller met
with the Dhioliba, for the first time, at Couroussa, and observed
its course. This point and this course, from the mere construction
of the new map of the route, are found to continue that traced by
the English traveller. At the point of meeting, there appears to be
a very small interval left, and I have therefore had no difficulty
in supplying this hiatus. Henceforward our knowledge of the
thirty-five or forty first leagues of the course of this great
river may be considered as perfectly established.</p>

<p>The second expedition of Major Laing, as all the world knows,
had for its object the city of Timbuctoo, which he endeavoured to
reach by way of Tripoli, not across the Bornou, like his immediate
predecessors, but by the direct route of the oasis of Agably. The
work, which, in the course of this paper, I have had frequent
occasion to quote, has made the reader acquainted with
<i>l’Itinéraire de Tripoli, de Barbarie à la ville de
Temboctou</i>, by the sheik Hagg-Cassem, revised by M. Delaporte,
vice-consul of France; an itinerary which I congratulate myself
upon having submitted, in 1818, to the Institute, since my learned
colleague M. Walckenaer, declares that it induced him to favour the
public with his <i>Recherches géographiques sur l’Intérieur de
l’Afrique septentrionale</i>. This document places Timbuctoo at
eighty-one days’ distance from Tripoli, and the oasis of Ain-Salah
and Agably at thirty-three days, or three sevenths of the way. We
are yet ignorant what observations Major Laing made on this route;
we only know that he passed Ghadamès and Ain-Salah, and we possess
his observation made in the latter place. This observation carries
much farther west the position admitted on the maps; but for
several reasons I have felt necessary to make use of it: 1st, Major
Laing proved himself a correct observer, in his travels in the
Timannie; 2ndly, the situation of Timbuctoo, being more westerly
than it has hitherto been considered, should carry with it that of
the oasis of Touat, which is in the direct line; 3rdly, there is
nothing in the itinerary of the sheik Hagg-Cassem, in opposition to
the more westerly tendency of this line of route; 4thly and lastly,
the computation of the day’s journey appears to me too low, when
reduced to fifteen geographical miles. The reasons, which induce me
to estimate it at eighteen miles and four tenths, will be found
elsewhere: it follows from this calculation, that the oasis of
Touat should be brought nearer to the ocean. This result agrees
with the more westerly position of the route from Timbuctoo to
Tafilet, as shewn by the journey of M. Caillié. Till some of the
papers of Major Laing are discovered, (and this hope is not
altogether lost, since M. Caillié himself, in traversing the great
desert saw a compass, and heard mention of a sextant which had
belonged to him), it is impossible to make further comparisons
between the travels of the French discoverer and the second
expedition of the Major, although both resided in the city of
Timbuctoo, almost in the same house, and though the latter nearly
reached el-Arawan.</p>

<p class="center">ANALYSIS OF THE ITINERARY MAP, AND OF THE GENERAL
MAP OF THE TRAVELS.</p>

<p>In constructing the maps here submitted to the reader, I was
unable to avail myself of the information procured by our
adventurer in his preceding travels, either in the Bondou, amongst
the Brakna Moors, or amongst the people in the neighbourhood of
Kakondy, the Nalous, the Bagos or the Landamas: these excursions
present no continuous progress susceptible of being traced on a
map. The fourth excursion alone, therefore, can enter into the
present discussion, namely the great journey from the Rio-Nuñez to
Tangier, commenced on the 19th of April 1827, and concluded on the
7th of September 1828; I shall consequently confine myself to a
mere glance at the former travels. The examination of this route
will be divided into three parts.</p>

<p>1st, Journey from Kakondy to Timé, beyond the Dhioliba.</p>

<p>2nd, Journey to Djenné, and navigation of the river thence to
Timbuctoo.</p>

<p>3rd, Journey from Timbuctoo to Arbate, and thence to
Tangier.</p>

<p>I shall then devote particular attention to the general map of
the travels.</p>
<br>

<h5><a id="cha_a1"></a>ART. I.</h5>

<p class="center">EARLY TRAVELS OF M. CAILLIÉ.</p>

<p>M. Caillié undertook his first excursion in 1819. From St.
Louis, he repaired to Goree by the usual route, that is to say, he
set out from Gandiolle, and followed the seashore without finding
any opportunity for making new observations. The whole of this
coast is perfectly well known from surveys by officers of the royal
navy.</p>

<p>In 1819, he associated himself with M. Adrien Partarrieu, who
was about to rejoin the expedition of Major Gray: the latter was
then in the Bondou, reduced to grievous extremities, and he sent
for M. Partarrieu, to bring him assistance, of which the expedition
stood in the utmost need.<a id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> It is to be regretted that
M. Caillié took no notes of his stages during this journey; the
line of route crossed that of M. Mollien, as well as that
subsequently followed by Captain Beaufort. The caravan passed
Boulibaba, a town inhabited by the Foulahs, and the situation of
which is unknown. This whole route indeed, deserves to be
determined and traced out on the maps: M.Caillié is amply justified
in not having noted these particulars, knowing that M. Partarrieu
was in possession of more accurate materials; whatever accounts or
geographical observations the latter traveller has transmitted
being every way worthy of attention. Information is wanting
respecting the desert space which on this side separates Cayor from
the Ghiolof, respecting Potaco in the country of Bondou, and the
whole transverse line from Gandiolle to Boulibané, the capital of
that state. M. Caillié left Boulibaba for Bakel, and returned with
his fellow-travellers to St. Louis by water, without having any new
observations to make upon the road.</p>

<p>M. Caillié’s third journey is more important, not only on
account of its object, his initiation into the African manners and
customs, and his preparation for an expedition into the interior
and all its attendant hardships but more particularly for the
curious descriptions which he has given of the journeys of the
Moors in the deserts, of their stations hitherto nearly if not
wholly unknown, and of the running or stagnant waters which he met
with. It is to be wished that it had been possible to trace these
positions upon the map; but I had not the means of fixing them with
sufficient exactness. It will be remarked in reading this relation
that the residence of the King of the Braknas is continually
varying; he frequently dwells in the vicinity of the river Senegal
and of the station known by the name of the Braknas. But in the wet
season he penetrates farther into the desert; and when he removes
his camp the entire population travels with him. The extent of
space subject to this powerful tribe has been hitherto known only
from east to west; but we learn from this account how far it
reaches towards the north.</p>

<p>It would be desirable to geographers to learn the precise
position of lake Aleg, that of the mountain called Ziré (a word
which however is a generic term), and the limits of the great tribe
of the Abou-sebas or el-Abou-sebah, the name of which is very
differently and incorrectly written upon the recent maps: those who
have supposed that the article formed part of the word, and that
the termination might be retrenched have made out of it the word
<i>labos</i>. Two terminations have been used <i>sebas</i> and
<i>sebah</i>; the last only is correct.</p>

<p>I shall confine myself to a remark upon the relative position of
Adar and the lake Aleg. According to our traveller, the distance
from the one to the other is seven days’ journey: how then shall we
reconcile the situation assigned to Adrar, not far from Ouâd-noun,
which is more than thirty days distant from the territory usually
attributed to the Braknas? It would be requisite that this
territory should extend northwards even to the extremity of the
Sahara, which is contrary to our received ideas, but perhaps not to
the fact.</p>

<p>M. Caillié, having returned in May 1824 to St. Louis, and
despairing to obtain the means necessary for accomplishing his
purposes, determined to remove to Albreda on the Gambia, and thence
to Sierra-Leone, where he succeeded in collecting some resources,
by availing himself of his already acquired information. On the
22nd of May, 1827, he embarked at Sierra-Leone for Rio-Nuñez, where
he arrived on the 31st. By the 5th of August he was established at
Rebecca (or Rabougga): where he employed himself at once in
completing the observations and information already extant upon the
neighbouring tribes, the Nalous, the Bacos, and the Landamas<a id=
"FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>,
and in making preparations for his great expedition. He soon
quitted this place for Kakondy: his activity, his perseverance,
uncommon intelligence, and finally the fortunate circumstances of
which he so skilfully took advantage, enabled him to set out on the
19th of the same month for Kankan. Ignorant as the world was of the
situation of this town, it would seem that a happy foresight guided
him in making choice of this direction, as in following it he
crossed the rivers with which it was most important to be
acquainted, in such a manner as to enable us tolerably well to
assign their position and their distance from the ocean.</p>

ROUTE.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<p class="center" style="font-size: smaller">GENERAL
OBSERVATION.</p>

<p>Before entering, in somewhat minute detail upon the examination
of M. Caillié’s routes, I should make an observation to warn the
reader against the apparent differences which he may observe
between the journal of the travels and the map of the route. To
render this journal fit for perusal, and not to interrupt
perpetually the description of places and people, it has been found
necessary to retrench the number of distances and bearings, to such
an extent that any one who should attempt to form a plan of the
route by the assistance of the narrative alone would fall into
serious errors: respecting this circumstance however the reader has
been already cautioned in a note in the first volume. The
construction of the lines of route upon the map which I have
designed is the result of all the indications given by the
traveller, and which I have collected in the form of a table. It is
also necessary to consult the following article, respecting the use
which I have made of these materials, to render them accordant with
anterior information and the positions already admitted as
incontestable.</p>

<p>The entire journey of M. Caillié, from Kakondy to Tangier
occupied five hundred and eight days: from which, in order to
obtain the days of actual travel, three hundred and one days of
stationary residence in eighteen different places, must be
deducted, which will leave two hundred and seven days’ travel. I
shall here subjoin a list of these places of residence, but it must
not be inferred that the traveller had no convenient means of
making observations in other stations, because it will be observed
that when he arrived early at any place of consequence, the
remainder of the day was spent there.</p>

<p>When it is proposed to offer a new map to the public it is an
indispensable duty to submit to inspection the elements which form
its basis, and not to ascribe to the work which results from them a
greater value than appertains to the materials; these again have no
other than what they derive, whether from the instruments and
methods which the traveller has employed, or from the manner in
which he has collected the observations and information which form
the basis of his description. M. Caillié was not provided with any
astronomical instruments; he had no watch, and measured the hour
only by the height of the sun; but he possessed two compasses which
were of great assistance to him. All his bearings were carefully
noted by this instrument during the day, and by the stars at night.
With regard to distances they were estimated according to several
experiments made by himself at Sierra-Leone while preparing for his
enterprise. He made a practice of walking over a certain space
measured exactly in English miles and of observing the time he
spent upon the road. It is thus that he calculated the number of
miles in each of his marches from Kakondy to Djenné at three
English miles an hour, or two geographical miles and six-tenths: as
far as Timbo, however, that is to say during the first days of the
journey, this number must be a little increased; this results from
the situation of Timbo, as determined by Major Laing; and <i>en
passant</i> we may observe that this part of M. Caillié’s journey
proves that the ancient position of Timbo, according to Watt and
Winterbottom, is totally inadmissible. This rate of two
geographical miles six-tenths an hour, or more exactly from two
miles four-tenths to two miles six-tenths, can in general only be
ascribed to isolated marches, and to caravans lightly laden. An
hour’s march of a lightly laden caravan seldom exceeds two
geographical miles three-tenths, and that of a numerous caravan
heavily laden does not exceed a mile and a half, or a mile and
three quarters<a id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class=
"fnanchor">[50]</a>.</p>

<p>On quitting Djenné, M. Caillié travelled by water. The current
of the river was slow, the obstacles arising from the faulty
construction of the vessel, the ignorance and unskilfulness of the
pilot, and the islands and sand-banks, reduce an hour’s direct
navigation to two English miles. Different causes producing,
however, similar results determine the same value for an hour’s
march in the deserts between Timbuctoo and Fez. This number of two
miles taken as an average for a long journey<a id=
"FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
admits of almost all possible differences in the degree of
expedition with which a caravan will move at different times: while
it forms also the intermediate length between the progress of a
caravan heavily and of one moderately laden, which was the case
with the caravans which M. Caillié accompanied from Timbuctoo, as
may be seen by his narrative.</p>

<p>This same deficiency of space with a variation in the bearings,
has caused the frequent breaks which I have been obliged to make in
the route on the itinerary map. The scale of a millionth part,
adopted for this map, is perhaps too small to describe the details
and all the angles of the route; I had, accordingly, at first
constructed it upon a scale of double dimensions, but this
development would have required too much space.</p>

<h6><a id="cha_a2_2"></a>FIRST PART OF THE JOURNEY.</h6>

<p>The line of route in the first part of the journey depends
essentially upon Timbo. This place is well worthy of attention both
in respect to its physical geography and to the European relations
with Africa. The English have always considered it as an important
station for commerce, but it is not less deserving of study as the
culminating point of this part of the continent. It is fortunate
that several travellers have made efforts to determine its
geographical situation. Major Laing has definitively fixed it in
latitude 10° 25’ north, and longitude 12° 54’ west from Paris; its
actual elevation above the sea remains to be correctly ascertained.
I could not establish M. Caillié’s route upon a better basis; and
this I have done, by means of a direction which the traveller
obtained from the village of Dité. There the inhabitants informed
him that Timbo was at two days’ distance in a certain direction,
towards which he immediately applied his compass and found it to
bear S. E. ¼ S. Now, we may observe (and it is a remark common to
the whole interior of Africa), that the inhabitants are scarcely
ever mistaken with respect to the bearings of places; their
accuracy in this respect is surprising; it is the effect of habit
and of a particular tact. Secondly, I subjected this line of route
to the position of the town of Labé, which is tolerably well known
though not so certainly as Timbo. Our traveller, when near Teléouel
learnt that Labé lay N. E. ¼ E. at two days’ distance. Another
confirmation is drawn from the position of Cambaya, in respect to
Timbo, which latter, according to the natives, bears W. S. W. at
two days’ journey from Cambaya. Here, then, are five points well
connected together, Teléouel, Labé, Dité, Timbo, and Cambaya,
forming a whole, the main support of which rests upon Timbo<a id=
"FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>.
From the nature of these data I have had no hesitation in
subjecting the route from Kakondy to them; and the result has been
that the hour’s march proves to be a trifle more than three English
miles, which, for the commencement of the journey, is not
extraordinary.</p>

<p>But, be this as it may, the construction of this route upon the
itinerary map has undergone no reduction or modification, and I
have confined myself to designing as accurately as the scale would
permit, all the angles of this line, the rivers which the traveller
crossed or had sight of, the different elevations of the soil with
his estimate of them, and in fact all the variations of the ground
which he has carefully noted.</p>

<p>At thirty-two miles from Kakondy is a fine river called
Tankilita, a name which much resembles that of Tingalinta, marked
in several maps at the same distance;<a id=
"FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
and which word is perhaps pronounced Tenkalita; it is the same,
according to the inhabitants, with the Rio-Nuñez; this stream,
which flows to the north, would, in this case, be only the origin
or principal tributary of the Rio-Nuñez.</p>

<p>Other rivulets or rivers, as the Bangala, the Doulinca, and the
Kakiriman, a large river in the neighbourhood of the high mountains
of Antegua, on the contrary flow towards the south. The soil is
chiefly composed of granite in this district and beyond it: the
mountains are very high, steep and pointed; chains still increasing
in elevation succeed each other; and there are among them mountains
two thousand feet in height. All this country, bordering on the
Fouta-Dhialon, presents an accumulation of obstacles, which are
with difficulty surmounted; and yet men and even women, with heavy
loads upon their heads, are continually traversing it. One of these
mountains, the Touma, forms the limit between the Tenanka and the
Fouta, and beyond it are the cataracts of the Cocoulo, a large and
very rapid river. Thence we proceed to the Bâfing, the chief arm of
the Senegal: it appears that its source is to the west of Timbo,
and that its course is to the west and north, (and not to the
east); this, at least, is the inference I draw from the new
itinerary; and the north-easterly course of the Tankisso, which
belonged to the bason of the Dhioliba, confirms this opinion.<a id=
"FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class=
"fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>We afterwards descend into vast and very fertile plains, watered
by the Tankisso, a large river, with steep banks, the Bandiegue and
others less considerable, till we reach the principal river of this
part of Africa, the Dhioliba.</p>

<p>On leaving the Soulimana the river takes a northerly direction,
as I have said above, on the authority of Major Laing, but
afterwards turns to the east. This bend is precisely given by a
distance in the new itinerary. It may be observed that the river
passes at one day’s journey to the south of Saraya. This bearing is
in perfect agreement with the map of Laing’s journey to the
Soulimana,<a id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class=
"fnanchor">[55]</a> which will confirm if necessary the position of
Saraya, and my plan of the route. It is known that the actual
height of its source above the level of the sea, is, according to
Major Laing, about sixteen hundred feet, or a hundred and thirty
more than the source of the Rokelle.</p>

<p>It was at Couroussa, in the little country of Amana, that our
traveller crossed it. Though so near to its source, it had already
attained a breadth of nine hundred feet, and the moderate velocity
of two miles and a half. At a short distance from this point, the
Yendan, a large river, falls into it; farther on it receives the
Milo, coming from the town of Kankan, and the Sarano, which waters
the rich plains of the Wassoulo. Proceeding towards the east, and
leaving the Dhioliba to the left, the traveller reached Timé.</p>

<p>The situation of Timé is determined by two data: the one, that
the march, throughout its whole length from Kakondy, was the same;
the caravan was equally numerous, and if the country is less
mountainous, the travellers were more fatigued, which forms a
compensation: the other is furnished by the meridian altitude of
the sun, twice taken at Timé, by means of the length of the shadow.
Imperfect as this observation probably was, we ought to have some
respect for it, when it coincides with the data of the itinerary; I
shall soon resume this subject.</p>

<p>To conclude the examination of this first part of the itinerary,
I shall make some remarks on the situation of the country, which
appears to be the spot where the waters of this portion of the
African continent separate. The first great line of partition is
that which divides the waters of the Senegambia from those of the
Soudan. The mountains which form it have their nucleus at Timbo,
where their distinction into separate ranges is totally lost.
Thence one range diverges to the north, and another to the east,
and it is remarkable that the divisions of the countries or states
correspond with the physical regions. Thus in the country called
Fouta-Dhialon, Timbo and its mountains are the sources of the
Rio-Grande, the Gambia, the Falemé, the Senegal, &amp;c. The
Soulimana and its fountains are the source of the Dhioliba on the
one side, and the Rokelle and the Mungo take their rise on the
other. From the backs of the mountains of the Fouta-Dhialon spring
the tributaries of the Dhioliba, as the Tankisso (which cannot be
an arm of the Senegal, as M. Caillié was informed): the spot where
it rises is not far from Timbo, and the true point of division
between the basons of the north and the east. Thus we have a
proximate acquaintance with the relief of the country, which
presents a satisfactory whole, where all appears to bear a natural
connection. To this result M. Caillié’s observations have
materially contributed.</p>

<p>Besides the line of division of which I have just spoken, there
is another which separates the waters of the Senegambia from those
of the Timannie; it is the result of an attentive examination of M.
Caillié’s route. He crossed in fact two considerable rivers: the
one, the Kakiriman, which is from seventy to eighty paces in
breadth; the other, the Cocoulo, which is forty-five; and both very
rapid. He saw them flowing to his right, that is southward, towards
the bason of the Timannie.<a id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Further on, that is after
Popoco, all the rivers which he crossed flow to the left, towards
the north, and into the Senegambia. Thus, between the route of M.
Mollien and that of M. Caillié, there must be a very elevated
mountain crest, running from N. W. to S. E. and passing near the
point of intersection of the two routes.</p>

<p>The names of the countries traversed by M. Caillié, in the first
part of his travels, deserve a particular examination. According to
the circumstantial description of the Baleya, it appears to me,
that Major Laing has placed on his map a village of Beilia, where
he ought to have marked and where in fact is, the country of
Baleya. The Firia of the maps is the same with the Fryia or the
Firya of M. Caillié; the Sangaran is nearly where it has been
placed upon the recent maps, but on both sides of the river. With
respect to the Couranco, if M. Caillié was rightly informed, it
extends considerably towards the N. W., whereas Major Laing
confines it to the interval between the rivers Rokelle and
Camaranca, in the south. This country borders it should seem on the
Baleya and the Soulimana. The true source of the Dhioliba is in the
Kissi, to the south of Couranco, according to M. Caillié (or of the
Soulimana, according to Major Laing). Thus the whole discrepancy
between the two travellers is reduced to the lengthening of the
country of Couranco; but, are the limits of these petty kingdoms
well defined, and are the natives themselves fully agreed as to
frontiers which violence is perpetually changing? On many maps the
names of Sangala and Couronia are to be found not far from Couranco
and Sangara. I suspect they are doing double duty here, as in so
many other instances in geography, either through the difference of
the orthography or the negligence of the transcriptions. Is not
Couronia altered from Couronca (Couranco) and Sangala, by the
frequent mutation of the <i>r</i> into <i>l</i>, from Sangara? The
Wasselon, or Wassoulo, should be placed much nearer to the ocean,
the incontestable consequence of M. Caillié’s march; and already
this example affords a presentiment of the fact as relates to the
course of the Dhioliba and all the districts which it traverses.
This river having also been supposed too much to the east by three
or four degrees, the result has been the necessity of lengthening
all the distances in order to cover the space between it and Timbo,
and the constructors of maps have scattered over this space the
names of countries and places, made all the positions too remote
from each other, and transformed hamlets into towns and towns into
kingdoms. They have not sufficiently remarked the custom common to
almost all travellers of lengthening distances by an exaggerated
estimate, and have neglected to make allowance for the frequent
curves and inflexions of the line of route: a double cause for
throwing into the interior many countries much nearer to the sea
than they are believed to be.</p>

<p>This want of exactness in the compiling of itineraries, or in
laying down those itineraries upon maps, is no novelty in
geography; the Ancients have furnished many examples of it, and the
maps designed after the positions of Ptolemy are nearly all tainted
with this defect; I shall mention Arabia alone as an example. But I
must here terminate this short digression, the subject of which
would almost furnish matter for a book equally useful and
instructive. I also pass over many names of countries with which M.
Caillié has made us acquainted, and which will figure for the first
time upon the map of Africa, and many more which are already known,
and the existence of which is now confirmed by authentic
testimony.</p>

<h6><a id="cha_a2_3"></a>SECOND PART OF THE TRAVELS.</h6>

<p>The largest portion of the space between Kakondy and Timé may be
regarded as an entirely new acquisition for geography; the same
remark applies to that which we are about to run over with our
traveller. We must not regret that he abandoned the banks of the
Dhioliba, and that this circumstance deprived us of information
concerning the banks of that river from Couroussa to Djenné; we are
indemnified for this loss by his discoveries respecting countries
of which we have hitherto been utterly ignorant. Moreover, had he
passed through Bamacou, Sego, and Sansanding, he would not have had
time to sojourn in them so long as Mungo Park did: he might,
perhaps, even have been recognised at Sego, and like Dochard have
been detained. Leaving the river far to the west, he became
acquainted with the tributary streams which traverse the triangular
space comprised between Couroussa, Timé, and Djenné, and with all
the positions of this vast tract. He also acquired information
concerning the positions situated near the rivers, and of all the
towns of any importance, by the attention which he paid to inquire
their distance and direction at different points of his route.</p>

<p>I have already observed that, the route from Timé to Djenné
having been performed under the same circumstances as the
preceding, the estimate of three English miles an hour applies to
this line of road; I have therefore admitted this with M. Caillié,
and I have had the satisfaction to see that, in forming this line,
without any alteration, upon the distances and bearings as he has
given them, the latitude of Sego would remain very nearly the same
as that which results from the observations of Mungo Park, made in
this vicinity.<a id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class=
"fnanchor">[57]</a> But this point remains for future examination,
when I shall discuss the situation of Timbuctoo. Thus the
delineation of this portion of the itinerary has not presented any
great difficulties. Some topographical circumstances relating to
this extent of country merit observation.</p>

<p>Beyond Timé the traveller proceeds for two days more towards the
east; he then turns to the (magnetic) north, and continues
afterwards in nearly the same direction, which ought to be borne in
mind. There are high mountains of granite at Timé, and again at
four days’ distance, after which the ground subsides and becomes
level. The sand is succeeded by a fertile soil, furrowed by the
frequent streams running westward towards the Dhioliba, amongst
others the Bagoe, a navigable river, and the Couara-ba. Tangrera,
near the commencement of this line, appears to be a large and very
commercial town; this point is placed, according to the journal to
the E. N. E. of Timé, (east by the compass), but not ten days to
the east as appears by the journal.<a id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> At Tiara a part of the
caravan directed their course upon Sansanding, and to the N. W.,
according to M. Caillié (the line traced on the map gives the true
N. N. W.); agreeably to the information which he obtained at
Badiarana. Caya is nine days to the north, and Sego nine days
farther on; now Sego (as it is placed upon the map, as I have
elsewhere said)<a id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59"
class="fnanchor">[59]</a> is situated due north by the compass,
with respect to Badiarana; but the eighteen days’ journey, if they
really exist, must be very short, occasioned probably by the
stagnant waters, and other obstacles, which render a winding course
necessary. The situation of Cayaye is determined by its bearing
upon Couara, five days to the N. N. W., which places it, as it
should be, half way upon the road between Badiarana and Sego. This
spot, Couara, doubly merits our present attention. I have had
occasion, in another work, to remark that this is a generic word,
the sense of which is analogous to that of river. Here we see
beside a village of this name a pretty considerable river called
<i>Couara-ba</i>, that is to say <i>river-river</i>; we have some
examples of a like denomination in <i>Ba-ba</i>, and other names of
the same kind; an additional reason for not identifying rivers and
currents on account of the similitude of their names, because it is
above all things necessary to know whether these names are generic
terms, or individual appellations.</p>

<p>In the second place, the Couaraba runs across a country through
which, according to the map of Mungo Park, a river called
<i>Banimma</i> passes, parallel with the Dhioliba; this would
appear impossible since the Couaraba falls into the latter stream,
if we may believe the report of the inhabitants.</p>

<p>This portion of the itinerary furnishes data for the site of a
country and even of a town called <i>Kong</i>, placed at a
considerable distance in all the maps. The bearing of a line
directed thither from Douasso is between S. S. E. and E. ¼ S. E. by
the compass, which is in fact due south; so much for its longitude:
but a distance of forty-five days’ journey would carry it much too
far to the south; doubtless the soil is very mountainous upon
nearly the whole road, and the journeys very short. If we stop at
the seventh parallel north, we shall make each day’s march but
seven or eight geographical miles, including the windings of the
route.</p>

<p>Still proceeding northward, the traveller crosses large open
plains and rich countries, bounded on the left by swamps, lakes, or
ponds, which indicate the neighbourhood of a large river. At length
he reaches its banks at Galia, opposite to Djenné, at ten miles
distance. Before we enter this capital, let us examine some
important geographical positions. Nothing could be more obscure
than the situation of Bouré; we were ignorant whether there existed
a town of this name, and even what was the site of the country of
Bouré: in the maps we shall find differences of several degrees. M.
Caillié did not visit Bouré; but, in throwing together all the
particulars which he collected, I find sufficient data to determine
the situation of this town; for there is a town, and a very
important one, on account of the vicinity of its rich gold mines,
and the commerce of which it is the centre. Bouré stands upon the
left bank of the Tankisso, a large tributary, as I have before
said, of the Dhioliba, and at three quarters of a day’s journey
from the latter in a direct line, or one day’s above the
confluence. These particulars which agree well together, were
furnished by various persons in various places. Moreover the
position of Bouré is given by its distance from Kankan; and its
bearing, namely, four or five days to the north, ¼ N. E., in
descending Milo. Finally, as a fourth testimony, we learn that
Bouré was five days’ march from Couroussa, descending the Dhioliba
in a canoe, and <i>afterwards ascending the Tankisso</i>.</p>

<p>Bamakou is known to us from the second journey of Mungo Park;
but its actual situation should be considerably further to the
west: the information obtained by M. Caillié, and the construction
of the map, place this town at about the tenth degree of longitude
west of Paris, and in latitude eleven degrees forty-five minutes.
The idea of forming an establishment there, is founded upon a real
knowledge of the country; it was long ago suggested in memorials
submitted to government, pointing out its advantages. The documents
of M. Caillié confirm the possibility of the scheme at the present
time. He thinks that from this point it is eight or ten days’
journey to the nearest point of the Senegal. Now, it appears, from
the map, that, by ascending the Bâfing, as far as thirty leagues
above the first cataract of Felou, we should be seventy leagues in
a direct line from Bamakou, which agrees very well with what has
gone before; this, however, is not the place for examining that
question.</p>

<h6><a id="cha_a2_4"></a>OBSERVATIONS ON THE COURSE OF THE DHIOLIBA
AS TRACED FROM COUROUSSA TO SEGO AND DJENNÉ.</h6>

<p>The course of the river, from Couroussa to Sego, as I have
traced it, deviates from the hitherto received opinions;<a id=
"FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
and I am bound to justify so material a change, when submitting it
to the judgment of geographers. In laying down the routes of M.
Caillié, I was not prepared for such a result, or rather I was
apprehensive of finding former conjectures relative to the much
more westerly position of the river, and of the towns through which
it flows destroyed by actual observations, as an illusion is
dissipated by the clear light of truth. It has however proved quite
otherwise, and this opinion was far from rash. In fact, beyond
Couroussa the river runs due N. E., then eastward, and afterwards
for a great distance to the north, instead of pursuing invariably
an eastern direction as marked upon the maps. But on what is this
latter direction supported? On what foundations does it rest? It
has no other cause than the position arbitrarily assigned to
Timbuctoo, much too far east, much too far from the mouth of the
Senegal. On the more modern maps attempts have, it is true, been
made to remove this position farther west; the necessity of
bringing it nearer to the ocean has been felt,<a id=
"FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
but it has not been advanced far enough, and has still been
retained in nearly the same parallel, instead of being brought at
the same time farther north.</p>

<p>If the objection be admitted that M. Caillié has carried his
route by water too far west, the result would then be that his
route from Timbuctoo to Fez must have been carried too far east:
now these two results are opposed to each other, since it is the
same line of route, and the same bearing, which lead from Couroussa
to Sego, from Sego to Timbuctoo, and from Timbuctoo to Fez.</p>

<p>One powerful consideration is that M. Beaufort has fixed and
ascertained the position of the town of Elimané, eastward of Bakel,
by a great number of observations; this is the present capital of
Kaarta. From that place travellers are daily going to Sego; our
unfortunate countryman was himself on the point of proceeding
thither, and would have done so but for the destitution caused by
the pillage of which he was a victim, and which compelled him to
turn back. He was then told that Ségo was only at ten days’
distance; that the bearing of Elimané with regard to Sego was E. S.
E.; and that these days’ journeys were journeys on foot. Let us
work on these data, and see whether they confirm the course of the
river drawn from the itinerary of M. Caillié.</p>

<p>Can these days’ journeys be computed at more than twenty-one
geographical miles? This can scarcely be admitted; but should they
even be extended to twenty-two miles and in a direct line, it would
be on the whole two hundred and twenty miles, which in the above
direction would not reach the ninth meridian west of Paris.</p>

<p>While M. Caillié was at Kiebala, he was told the distances and
bearings of Sego, which differ very little from the position
resulting from that of Elimané in the opposite direction; and if
the river was here carried eastward, as it is found in all the maps
calculated from Park’s travels, there would no longer be any
agreement between these two different sources of information. If,
on the contrary, these respective data are preserved, they
naturally harmonize, and the northerly course of the stream is
confirmed.</p>

<p>Besides, the latitude of Sego, although not yet observed, cannot
greatly differ from that of Sami, which is near it: the observation
there made by Mungo Park gives thirteen degrees seventeen minutes,
and this is perhaps, a little too northerly. The approximative
position of Sego, resulting from various data, and which I have
adopted as a medium, would thus be, latitude thirteen degrees;
longitude, nine degrees west.</p>

<p>Sego, according to the itinerary, lies due north by the needle
of Badiarana, that is north seventeen degrees west. This direction
exactly passes through the position which I have assigned to Sego,
from the observation of Sami, by Mungo Park.</p>

<p>The bearing of Sego is likewise precisely indicated by the N. N.
W. line of the compass, drawn from Saraclé.<a id=
"FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class=
"fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>The course of the Dhioliba, from Sego to Jenné, west and east,
and the position of Sego, are still more strongly confirmed by data
with which the traveller was furnished at Bamba. Sego is three
days’ journey N. W. of that place; and at noon on the fourth, the
city of Sego is reached: these are long days’ journeys. The
proportion of three to four, or rather of three to three and two
thirds, will be actually found as I have traced it.</p>

<p>Lastly, it is elsewhere expressly said, that Sego is five days
west of Jenné; the new map gives W. ¼ S. W. All these data, it is
plain, perfectly coincide; and although they are not authenticated
by a single good celestial observation, yet they agree too well
together to allow one to venture upon deranging the whole itinerary
of our traveller, and carrying the city of Sego and with it the
whole course of the river, two or three degrees farther east, when
besides there exists no observation whatever, either geographical
or astronomical, for carrying the river and its towns farther into
the interior of the continent.</p>

<p>The position of Djenné, the arms of the river by which it is
surrounded, its situation in a large island apart from the
Dhioliba, the stream which branches off in the neighbourhood of
Sego, and rejoins the river at Isaca, four days further on, are so
many circumstances all equally new, and which tend greatly to
modify our previous notions. Looking at this complication of
details, the obscurity and contradictions contained in all the
accounts of the negroes on the subject of Djenné may be easily
conceived; but, upon an attentive study and careful comparison of
the different data, we arrive at a tolerably just idea of these
localities: the reader will judge whether I have attained this
object in the course of these observations and in the drawing here
submitted to him. Unquestionably, there yet remain many
circumstances to be learnt relating to this double branch of the
Dhioliba, the true form and actual extent of the island of Djenné,
and its double or perhaps triple communication with the branches of
the river; for every step yet gained in our acquaintance with this
mysterious river seems to throw us to a greater distance from the
ultimate object: it is, therefore, to confess the truth, nothing
more than a slight sketch that I have presumed to delineate; time
will rectify our yet imperfect notions, and complete the
observations of our indefatigable traveller, when the use that I
have made of them may be judged of. M. Caillié presumes the island
of Djenné to be eighteen miles in circumference; but the
construction of the route and the general appearance of the map
induce me to believe that it is of greater extent: I also suspect,
that the junction of the island with the western branch of the
river cannot be seen from Djenné, but only its junction with the
eastern branch; this would be a natural consequence of the westerly
situation of Sego, with regard to Djenné. For the rest, I refer to
the observations in the following article, that this discussion may
not be prolonged here.</p>

<p>I shall not stay to inquire how it happened that Mungo Park knew
nothing of a second branch of the river, when he proceeded from
Sego to Silla. I shall likewise abstain from entering into further
developments respecting the course of the Dhioliba beyond Djenné.
The narrative furnishes ample details, not less instructive than
new, respecting the course of the river, its depth, its immense
width in some parts, to the extent of half or even a whole mile.
One of the most interesting points of this route by water is the
great lake Debo, or Dhiebou, which M. Caillié met with half-way
between Djenné and Timbuctoo. I cannot help thinking that this lake
is the same which figures on the maps under the name of Dibbie, but
with a widely different position, form, and extent.</p>

<p>The enthusiasm of our traveller at the sight of this sea of
fresh water must appear excusable to every one, and his eagerness
to take possession, in a manner, of the spot, on behalf of his
country, by giving names to three islets situated in it, cannot but
be generally approved. Twenty three years earlier, Mungo Park had
accomplished this same navigation, perhaps, had also given names to
these little mediterranean isles. Who, either in France or in
England would have blamed him for this national feeling, had the
account of his discovery reached Europe?.</p>

<p>The lake has two divisions, one eastern, the limits of which may
be seen, the other western, extending beyond the reach of sight. M.
Caillié is ignorant whence this mass of water proceeds; is it from
a tributary, or is it, on the contrary an efflux from the
inundations of the Dhioliba? This geographical question, on many
accounts an important problem, remains then in obscurity; further
on I shall offer a rather probable opinion<a id=
"FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class=
"fnanchor">[63]</a>.</p>

<p>To the east of this lake are sands and sterile hills; to the
west, it is lost in vast marshes; the navigation of the latter
division must be extremely difficult. Passing from Djenné to
Timbuctoo, the traveller navigates the eastern division of the
lake, keeping close to the right bank.</p>

<p>Below the lake (on the map) a winding of the river will be
observed, which perhaps appears forced and unnatural; it results
from the lines of route as noted down and the difficulty of
substituting any thing else has alone determined me to retain it,
although doubtful of its accuracy: an error, however, in this
tracing will have little influence on the general result.</p>

<p>In approaching Cabra, the port of Timbuctoo, M. Caillié
perceived to the right a large arm of the river, running E. N. E.
and he continued to navigate the other, holding a north-west
course. He was informed that the latter rejoined the first at some
distance; but this important fact has not been verified by any
European eye; the traveller could not have ascertained it, without
repairing himself, at considerable risk, to the point of junction.
As for the inhabitants, perfectly indifferent as to obtaining or
transmitting intelligence of this sort, they spoke very vaguely to
him on the subject. The problem, therefore, of the ulterior
direction, and of the final termination of these branches of the
river, is yet to be resolved; I defer this discussion to a
subsequent article<a id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64"
class="fnanchor">[64]</a>, as well as the particular question of
the situation of Timbuctoo<a id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>; and shall conclude this
with repeating, that the itinerary from Timé to Galia, and from
Galia to Timbuctoo, has been framed on the calculation of two miles
an hour.</p>

<h6><a id="cha_a2_5"></a>THIRD PART OF THE TRAVELS.</h6>

<p>The progress of M. Caillié through the desert has also been
estimated at two miles an hour, at least as far as Tafilet, and
that for reasons explained at the beginning. The principal interest
presented by this part of the route consists in the exact
information it contains of the wells and stations to be met with
amidst this ocean of sand. Science is indebted to M. Caillié for
numerous and correct notions of these vast solitudes, which
travellers cannot confront without consternation. Thus, we knew the
spot called el-Araouan only by the wells found there, as a place at
which the caravans usually fill their water-skins; but our
traveller informs us that it is an important town: seeing it thus
surrounded on all sides by the deserts, we are the less surprized
at the situation of Timbuctoo in the midst of the sands.</p>

<p>The wells of Telig are remarkable for the vicinity of granite
mountains, and for the neighbourhood of Toudeyni, which, in all the
maps, is carried far to the west of the line between Timbuctoo and
Tafilet. M. Caillié’s description leaves no room for supposing that
he is treating of some other place of the same name, since this
city is well known to be a great mart for salt. I pass over in
silence the immense banks of moving sand, and the rare accidents of
the soil, which scarcely vary throughout this long tract of road,
the dreary uniformity of which is interrupted only by the wells.
Beyond the wells of Mayara appear the last branches of the chain of
Mount Atlas. The granite shews itself at first in fragments and
hillocks, afterwards in high hills and steep mountains. Twelve
days’ journey beyond el-Harib, we enter the district of Tafilet.
Here the report of M. Caillié is widely different from the received
opinions: 1st. He heard nothing of any <i>town of Tafilet</i>, it
is merely, he says, the name of a country. It is nevertheless
possible that a town may have heretofore existed there, and have
disappeared like so many other towns of central Africa. I observe
in the travels of Ebn-Hassan from Fez to Tafilet, quoted in the
<i>Recherches sur l’Afrique septentrionale</i><a id=
"FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>,
&amp;c. that the territory only of Tafilet is mentioned and not the
town; which would support the account of M. Caillié. 2ndly. This
country is much nearer to the meridian of Fez than it is marked on
all the maps<a id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class=
"fnanchor">[67]</a>. 3rdly. It is farther north<a id=
"FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>,
Ghourland, M. Caillié informs us, is the principal place in this
territory; near it is a place called Afilé, and another of the name
of Boheim<a id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class=
"fnanchor">[69]</a>, besides Ressant, the residence of a governor
under the Emperor of Morocco. M. Caillié mentions another position
unknown upon the maps; a large town called Rauguerute or Rogrut, S.
S. E. from Morocco.</p>

<p>The narrative presents but few details concerning the crossing
of Mount Atlas; it is not a matter of surprize that, after so many
fatigues and perils, our adventurer should be impatient to reach
the end of so long a journey. However, I observe in this part the
course of a little river or brook, called the Guigo, flowing from
Soforo (or perhaps from beyond) towards M-Dayara, and probably as
far as Tafilet. Upon carefully examining the traveller’s route, we
perceive that he first saw the Guigo, or had some knowledge of it,
between Rahaba, and L-Eyarac, afterwards at Tamaroc, and Kars; that
he crossed it at L-Eksebi; and that the river fertilizes the
environs of N-Zeland, L-Guim, Guigo, and Soforo. The water-mills
which our traveller saw at Soforo again announce the presence of
the same river. Thus the part of its course with which we are
acquainted will be at least fifty leagues in length and probably
much more. I do not know whether it passes to el-Fez, where however
several different rivulets are seen.</p>

<p>Neither was the journey across the Sahara altogether
unprofitable with regard to our knowledge of the oases and of the
stations which it contains. The distances of these places from the
several points of his route were reported to our traveller; and
these distances are very different from those previously admitted:
but are there two accordant testimonies concerning these positions?
Each caravan and each tribe makes a different estimate of the
intervals; and if, to the actual mistakes which the Moors and
natives may commit, the errors in which they are interested be
added, what a source of uncertainty will these present! Therefore,
though I have fixed upon the general map the points of Tychyt,
Oualet, Ouadan or Hoden, Ouad-Noun, &amp;c., according to the
indications of M. Caillié, combined with other documents, I
consider them as very uncertain. Oualet, says our traveller is at
ten days’ distance from el-Araouan, to the west, fifteen north from
Sego, and eighteen from Ouadan: this point falls near nineteen
degrees of latitude and nine degrees forty minutes longitude west
from Paris: the three lines meeting at nearly the same point. But
if it agrees with the three data given above, it is at variance
with the situation of Oualet, as hitherto admitted, either from
Mungo Park, or the testimony of the natives. It is perhaps another
place named Oualet, not that intended by Mungo Park. Can it be the
Gualata of Leo Africanus? but his description suits this no
better.<a id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class=
"fnanchor">[70]</a> In this case Gualata would be much farther to
the south than is generally supposed. It is however certain that
geographers cannot confound the Walet of Mungo Park with
Gualata.</p>

<p>Although M. Caillié has not mentioned Agably which is believed
to be the chief place of the oasis of the Touats, I have been
obliged to insert it in the map, because the traveller gives a
position called Touat much nearer to the route from Timbuctoo to
the Tafilet. It is not surprising that several places should be so
called, because the wandering tribe bearing this name occupy a
considerable portion of the great desert, from the south of Morocco
to beyond Agably. Besides, the situation of this place, which could
not have been brought within the limits of the map, if we were to
adopt the mere reports of the Arabs, to which geographers have had
recourse, falls there, on the contrary, according to the
astronomical observation of Major Laing, who fixes it much farther
to the west. This observation is published, for the first time; I
owe it to my learned friend Captain Sabine, himself united in the
most affectionate intimacy with the unfortunate traveller, who
transmitted it to him after sustaining a first attack on leaving
this oasis. Nor was it at Agably that Major Laing made the
observation, but at Ain-Salah, belonging to the same canton and at
two days’ journey from it; this place is cited in all the
itineraries between Tripoli and the western Soudan. According to
the Major its situation is twenty nine minutes west of Paris, and
twenty-seven degrees eleven minutes thirty seconds north latitude.
Notwithstanding the difference between this and the situation
allotted to this town upon all the maps, I have thought it right to
enter it in the general map of the travels.</p>

<p>The other places of the Sahara, such as Akka, Tatta,

"fnanchor">[71]</a> for want of new data, have been fixed from a
comparison of those upon which the map of M. Walckenaer, or those
of Messrs. Lapie, Brué, Berghaus, &amp;c., were formed. With
respect to the names of tribes and colonies, I have endeavoured to
place them with all possible exactness, and have been obliged to
differ from several recent maps in other respects very
valuable.</p>

<p>To the right of his route, and in front of el-A’raouan, M.
Caillié heard of an important situation, that of Sala; but the
accounts were too vague to be compared with the descriptions of the
Arabs.</p>

<p>I shall finish the examination of this third part of the travels
by the general list of the wells and stations of the desert on the
line from Timbuctoo to Fez; which line appears to be the most
advantageous and the shortest, because it is the most frequented.
It seemed to me that the collection of all these names into a
single table might be of some utility. It will be remarked that
Toudeyni does not appear in this list: may not this place be
without water fit for drinking? and has Telig succeeded it as a
more convenient station for caravans? I submit this doubt to the
reader.</p>

<h5>ARTICLE III.</h5>

<p class="center"><a id="cha_a3_1"></a>REMARKS ON THE GENERAL MAP
OF THE TRAVELS AND THE ELEMENTS WHICH SERVE FOR ITS BASIS.</p>

<p>Having completed the construction of the itinerary, it remained
to subject all these lines of route to the invariable data of which
geography is already possessed. I first sought among these data for
points common to M. Caillié’s march: they are unfortunately very
few in number. How then could I flatter myself, whatever trouble I
might take, with whatever care I might combine all the data,
hazarding nothing without some authority to support it, that I
should produce any thing beyond a mere essay? If it should be
hereafter confirmed by the observations of travellers furnished
with astronomical instruments, the only merits of this work will
consist in fortunate combinations; if it should be falsified by
future discoveries, still it will have called for the criticism of
geographers, and will consequently not have been useless to
science. In submitting to the reader results differing from those
hitherto admitted, I wish to warn him against an error, too common,
especially in map-making, that of giving the preference to the more
recent publications, and to place confidence in them in proportion
as they are so. I am far from desirous of usurping this species of
interest, to the prejudice of geographical works in general
estimation.</p>

<p>The points common to the route of M. Caillié and to the list of
positions considered by geographers as perfectly or sufficiently
established, are confined to the following: the points of the
Western coast of Africa, Kakondy, Timbo, Sami and Yamina (for the
latitude), Bakel, Elimané, Fez; and I shall add to them the
position of Ain-Salah, though published here for the first time.
With respect to the positions of Djenné, Timbuctoo, and the places
situated in the great desert, the uncertainty is so great, that
there is no resting any solid calculation upon them, and they are
of no use in verifying the exactness of new itineraries.</p>

<p>Thus we are reduced, for a space which comprehends twenty five
degrees of latitude and from ten to twelve degrees of longitude, to
eight points in the interior.<a id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Still, the point whence
the traveller set out on the first part of his travels, the
position of Timbo in the middle of this part, and the very probable
knowledge of the parallel of Sego, a town which is connected with
the itinerary and attaches itself to the fixed points of the
Senegambia, with the almost certain situation of Fez, form a first
basis, which may serve to verify as well the inflections of the
route as the length of the lines travelled over. I began by
establishing the lines from Kakondy to Timé, from Timé to Djenné
and Timbuctoo, and from Timbuctoo to el-Araouan; first, by
supporting them separately upon Timbo, the parallel of Sego, and
the position of Fez; and secondly, by attending to the declination
of the compass. These lines were at first formed without any other
modification than the necessary substitution of the true north for
the magnetic north, in the night journeys. The direction of the
first line from Fez gave me a very fair position for Timbuctoo; and
that of the second line from Timé furnished me with another but
little different, and which the situation of the parallel of Sego
brought considerably nearer to the first: whatever uncertainty
still remained has been cleared up by new data, of which it would
have been difficult not to have made some use.</p>

<p>Whilst at Timé, the idea struck M. Caillié of observing the
length of the shadow of a style at midday; his long stay there gave
him an opportunity of making the observation twice: the first time,
which was on the 30th of October 1827, the height of the style,
with every reduction, was 0,706 metre; that of the meridian shadow
was equal to 0,2945 metre.<a id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> The second observation was
made on the 1st of November 1827; but this measurement cannot have
been taken with so much precision. It was the shadow, properly
speaking, which was measured, that is to say, the shadow
terminating distinctly and without the penumbra. The calculation
gives for the latitude as nearly as possible nine degrees.<a id=
"FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class=
"fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>This being admitted, I perceived that the construction (made in
the manner before explained) of the line which represents the first
part of the journey, gave to the situation of Timé the same
latitude within a few minutes. This agreement convinced me that no
change was required in the construction; so small a difference,
considering the insufficiency of the means employed, might indeed
be regarded as an entire concordance, and I could not but suppose
that it was probably the effect of a fortunate compensation for
many errors on the contrary side. I might therefore look upon Timé
as a point nearly fixed, and leave it to establish the other two
lines. The longitude of Timé, resulting from the preceding
operations, is nine degrees two minutes west of Paris. Thus Timé
would be at a nearly equal distance from the equator and from the
meridian of Paris.</p>

<p>The bearing of the line from Kakondy to Timé, according to the
travels of M. Caillié, having been confirmed, has given me
confidence in the bearings of the rest of the route. I have
therefore first laid down the line from Timé to Timbuctoo, and that
from Timbuctoo to Fez, such as they result from the construction of
the map of the route. The point of Fez being fixed, it became
necessary to modify a little the absolute length and the direction
of these lines, to confine myself between the two points of Timé
and Fez, and I have proceeded upon a proportionate reduction. The
difference was nothing extraordinary for so long a route, amongst
so many obstacles and difficulties which the indefatigable
traveller had to overcome. It amounted on the whole, upon near
three thousand English miles,<a id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> to about one hundred and
fifty, or a twentieth part of the space travelled over, and the
total angular difference is less than six degrees upon the angle
between the meridian of Kakondy and the direction upon Arbate. The
latitude of Timbuctoo, obtained by this means, is near seventeen
degrees fifty minutes north.</p>

<p>Possessing upon this latitude no geographical data properly so
called, having only the routes of caravans, and not even the hours
of march, but merely the reckoning of the day’s journey, so that to
the uncertainty of the length of the journeys is added the still
greater uncertainty of the pace of the caravans, according to
whether they were more or less numerous, whether composed of camels
more or less laden, or only of pedestrians; together with our
ignorance as to the number and situation of the forced halts which
they make in the desert, either on account of wells, or of those
unforeseen accidents which will happen in these terrible
peregrinations;<a id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81"
class="fnanchor">[81]</a> in the midst, I say, of so many causes of
hesitation, which ought to warn geographers against the employment
of the vague itineraries of the Arabs and the Moors, could I grant
less confidence to the route of M. Caillié than to the marches of
the Africans?</p>

<p>These routes are constantly divided by hours: the rests are
noted with exactness, and they are never undecided with respect to
the length of the marches: it only remains then to estimate the
pace, and we are enlightened on this latter subject by the
composition of the caravan. For these reasons, and others still
which it would occupy too much time to explain; I have not thought
it right to take preceding itineraries into account in combining
the elementary facts necessary for ascertaining the position of
Timbuctoo.</p>

<p>I should, however, have still remained in doubt, and have
abstained from offering an opinion had there not been other new
data susceptible of comparison with the itinerary of M. Caillié; I
mean the measure of the meridian shadow which he took at Timbuctoo
itself. This observation was made by the same method as that at
Timé: this proceeding is undoubtedly very imperfect, but, for want
of others I think it should not be entirely neglected. On the 1st
of May 1828 our traveller planted a style of the height of 0,635
metre; he measured, at noon, the shadow of this style and found it
equal to 0,030 metre.<a id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82"
class="fnanchor">[82]</a> The calculation gives seventeen degrees
fifty one minutes north latitude. I must repeat here the reflection
that this agreement may very probably result from contrary errors
which have balanced each other: but as it is impossible to discover
the points in which the errors lie, or the limit of their extent,
the final result is all that can be obtained.</p>

<p>I will add one consideration which will not have escaped those
geographers who have studied the calculation of probabilities. In a
series of observations made under the same circumstances, and
especially by the same observers, the greater the number, the more
probable is it that their amount will approach to the total
quantity required. When there is no reason that the errors
committed should be on one side rather than another, they mutually
destroy each other, and the more so, the more the observations are
multiplied. There is even a rule which teaches us how much the sum
found differs from the truth; its discovery belongs to the learned
geometrician, who is at present the organ of the French Institute
for mathematical science. Knowing the error which may have occurred
in an observation, it must be multiplied by the square root of the
total number of observations. Thus, instead of growing with this
number the total possible error decreases proportionably. For
example, for four observations it would be represented by two, and
for a hundred observations, by ten only. The proportion of total
errors is therefore as ¹⁰⁄₂ whereas the proportion of the number of
observations is as ¹⁰⁰⁄₄: thus the error is but the fifth part of
what it would be proportionally in four observations.<a id=
"FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
Hence it follows that the more observations are multiplied the more
any imperfection in the processes by which they have been made will
be corrected.</p>

<p>Are we not authorised to apply this principle to the length of
M. Caillié’s stages, since the number of the lines of route is not
less than six hundred and thirty three? I may add that the same
remark applies to the angular deviation. Indeed, considering the
total distance between the meridian of Timé and that of Fez, or the
difference in longitude (which is equal to one degree forty four
minutes) as being the real sum of all the angles of the route to
the east or west of the first, it will follow that the forming of
the lines of bearings noted by the traveller (or the calculation of
the angles, which is more exact) gives a total variation, so much
nearer to the above difference of longitude as the number of
bearings is greater; and this number is also six hundred and thirty
three. As it has been seen above, I have found the deviation equal
to less than six degrees, and it has been easy to divide it over
the whole line.</p>

<h6><a id="cha_a3_2"></a>OBSERVATIONS ON THE SITUATION OF
TIMBUCTOO, AND PARTICULARLY ON ITS LONGITUDE.</h6>

<p>From the determination of the lines which join Timé, Djenné,
Timbuctoo, and Fez, and from the latitude of Timbuctoo thus fixed
according to the itinerary at seventeen degrees fifty or fifty one
minutes,<a id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class=
"fnanchor">[84]</a> necessarily results a more westerly longitude
of this city, than has been hitherto supposed, and even than that
which I had formerly admitted, and which brings its position much
nearer to the ocean than any geographer has placed it.</p>

<p>Such is the importance of the situation of Timbuctoo that I deem
it necessary to insist again on the discussion of the elements; in
order, not to establish it with certainty (I am far from believing
that I have accomplished this) but to furnish the reader with new
means of approaching the truth, as nearly as the state of our
knowledge will permit. It is true that a single astronomical
observation made by a skilful observer, furnished with good
instruments, and worthy of confidence, might overthrow these
inductions; but it is equally true that till we are possessed of
such an observation, no geographer can fix this main position on a
map, without deducing all the reasons which determine him,
especially if he dissents from the opinions of his
predecessors.</p>

<p>Timbuctoo is placed, on the general map of the travels, in the
latitude resulting from the observation of the shadow and the
length of the route from Timé to Timbuctoo. A great part of this
route, it may be observed, is in a northerly direction, which was
far from being conjectured from the course of the river in this
quarter. If Mungo Park could have acquainted us with the
particulars of his journey beyond Sansanding, we should not have
been so long uncertain of this direction, which has uniformly been
carried easterly, and that because the situation of Timbuctoo was
imagined (as it is still) to be very central in the continent.
Park’s map (travels in 1805) places it under the meridian of Paris;
Clapperton at 0° 5° west. Rennell at 2° 3°: but the data of which
we have been for ten years in possession oblige us to bring it
nearer to the ocean; M. Walckenaer has done so, in adopting a
longitude from nine to twelve minutes more westerly. I have always
proposed to carry this position much farther west, and even placed
it four years ago four degrees west.<a id=
"FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
M. Brué has since adopted 3° 34’: perhaps it should have been
advanced as far as the sixth degree. For the reasons I have
elsewhere given, the route from Timbuctoo to Fez cannot be fixed at
more than two English miles an hour: to this rate I have reduced
the computation of M. Caillié, who at first estimated the whole
route equally at three miles. Now the line of route thus
constructed and resting upon Arbate, a well known position, carries
Timbuctoo very near the eighteenth degree north; that is to say,
from 17° 50’ to 17° 55’; had not this been shortened a little, the
city would have been carried to 19°, or 20°, a position far too
northerly, and totally inadmissible. Moreover, the line from
Timbuctoo to Arbate would be ten degrees too far west; it would
also be increasing the declination to 27° instead of 17°, which
seems to be its amount for the mean meridian.</p>

<p>But, if the bearing of the line from Timbuctoo to Fez resulting
from the itinerary, and that of the line from Timé to Timbuctoo,
are preserved, these two intersect each other about the parallel of
17° 50’. This latitude agrees so well with that resulting from the
height of the shadow, 17° 51’ that we derive from these data a very
satisfactory confirmation. Now the line of the parallel 17° 51’ and
the two lines of direction meet, all three, on nearly the same
meridian, the sixth west from Paris.</p>

<p>No positive data are yet known which can better fix the
longitude: not only are the itineraries of the Moors too vague, but
they support themselves upon the Mediterranean, while M. Caillié’s
routes, though they are continued to the Mediterranean, support
themselves upon the ocean; which is much nearer than the former,
and also upon the known positions of Timbo and Fez.</p>

<p>Suppose, however, it were determined, notwithstanding all these
reasons to withdraw Timbuctoo farther to the east by a degree or
more, it would then become necessary greatly to increase the
journeys from Kakondy to Timé. In making them three English miles
and three fifths an hour, the true measure has probably been
somewhat exceeded, but the situation of Timbo compelled this;
while, to place Timbuctoo on the third degree of west longitude,
would be to suppose a march of more than four miles and a half an
hour.</p>

<p>Another circumstance here comes to our assistance: it is that by
carrying it farther towards the east, we must suppose the traveller
greatly and constantly deceived in a western direction on his
journey from Timé to Timbuctoo, and, on the contrary, in going from
Timbuctoo to Fez, he must have made a similar and not less
considerable error in all his bearings towards the east. How should
we account for this singularity?</p>

<p>From all these considerations, could I risk changing the result
of M. Caillié’s itinerary and altering the construction of his
route? could I, in short, without sufficient motive, give the
preference to any one map over another? Some judgment may be formed
upon this question from the diversity of situations assigned to
Timbuctoo by different authorities:</p>

<p>It is on the English maps, even those of most recent date, that
this town has always been placed the most to the east. The
advantage of a more eastern position relatively to the proximity of
a great river flowing into the Gulf of Guinea would be evident: but
this proximity is nothing less than certain. By a coincidence
worthy of notice the English maps have also brought Timbuctoo
farther to the south than any others except Delile, as will appear
from this table of different latitudes:</p>

<p>I return to the latitude of Timbuctoo. Ain-Salah, in the oasis
of Touat, is usually placed about 1° east of Paris and in 24° 30’
north latitude; but Major Laing’s observation, as communicated to
me by Captain Sabine, is very different, namely: 0° 29’ west of
Paris, and 27° 11’ 30". M. Walckenaer has calculated the distance
from this oasis to Timbuctoo at six hundred and seventy five
geographical miles: it is evident that this measure, if admitted,
would advance Timbuctoo towards the north to between the 17th and
18th degree; now, it happens that this distance of six hundred and
seventy five miles is found exactly between the two points as
placed upon the present map. This last coincidence, which I
remarked after my labour was concluded, contributed still farther
to dispel my doubts. I have estimated the day’s journeys at 18’
four tenths and not with M. Walckenaer at 15’; but it was the
medium journeys, not those of the great caravan, which formed the
object of his researches. It appears then that the approximative
situation assigned to Timbuctoo, 6° west and 17° 50’ north,
satisfies the different data, and the best itineraries, that it
agrees with the positions of Timbo and of Fez, and that it is not
contradicted by Mungo Park’s observations on the latitude, taken at
Sami and Yamina; finally, it is confirmed by the particulars
brought from Elimané by Captain Beaufort.</p>

<p>Fifty four days’ journeys will be found on my map from Timbuctoo
to Tatta; an itinerary cited by M. Walckenaer (p. 297) marks fifty.
The fifty four days from Fez to Timbuctoo according to Mr.
Jackson<a id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class=
"fnanchor">[86]</a> also agree: it is the same with the sixty-four
days from Timbuctoo to Morzouk. Fewer than twenty eight journeys
are reckoned from Houssa to Timbuctoo, according to the itinerary
of Mohammed Ebn-Foul; this distance is too short on our map, and on
all the others, even those in Clapperton’s travels. There are,
besides, other reasons for believing that there may be two towns or
countries called Houssa<a id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>.</p>

<p>I do not compare with the map the distance reckoned between
Timbuctoo and the town of Tafilet, because M. Caillié heard no
mention of a town so called: he affirms that none such exists, in
which case it is not possible to make use of this distance.</p>

<p>I shall add in conclusion of this discussion, that nothing can
authorise us to depart from the observations of latitude taken by
Mungo Park, at Yamina and Sami, namely, 13° 15’ and 13° 17’, and to
remove these points much further to the south, as M. Brué has done
upon his map, otherwise so rich in details and nomenclature. The
determination which I propose for the latitude of Timbuctoo agrees
better with these observations, the only ones we possess in this
direction as far as Timbuctoo.</p>

<p>From the whole discussion, it results, first, that the different
lines of route forming the itinerary map have been subjected to
divers conditions resulting from the journal of the traveller, from
anterior observations and from good geographical data; secondly,
that the hour’s journeys, estimated at three English miles, mean
measure, between Kakondy and Galia or Djenné, are a little
increased between Kakondy and Timé, in consequence of the position
of Timbo; thirdly, that, from Djenné to Timbuctoo and thence to
Fez, the average of two miles an hour has been a little modified by
the real difference in latitude of the two extremities. I have now
only to speak of the bearings and measure of the lines of
march.</p>

<h6><a id="cha_a3_3"></a>BEARINGS OF M. CAILLIÉ’S ROUTES.</h6>

<p>The reduction of the true north of our traveller’s lines of
route was one of the most important points; and to arrive at their
actual bearing, I was assisted by a single new datum only; namely,
the observation of the angle of the meridian shadow with the
magnetic north. The travels furnish two of these observations: the
one, of the 30th of October 1827, gave the N. N. E.; the other of
the 1st of November, the N. ¼ N. E., that is to say, the compass
had on these days a declination of 22° 30’ and 11° 15’ to the east.
I was then obliged to have recourse to other researches to
determine between these two measures, and to avail myself of
several observations taken by Mungo Park and other travellers.</p>

<p>In Mungo Park’s journal of his second expedition, as printed in
London, is a tracing of the Gambia,<a id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> from which a smaller
declination would result: it appears evident to me, that some error
has crept in here, either in the copying or in the engraving, when
the coincidence of the preceding observations from five different
travellers is considered, and particularly that of Park’s own
observations.<a id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class=
"fnanchor">[93]</a> To these might be added the declination
observed by Major Laing in his first journey, and that which has
been observed at Sierra-Leone and other places; but this inquiry
would be superfluous. It will be remarked, that the mean term of
16° 55’ declination east, is also the mean between the two
observations of M. Caillié; but, as the observation of Badoo seems
hither small compared with all the others, I have thought myself
entitled to adopt 17° as the mean declination and to subject the
whole route to it.</p>

<p>I shall here make another remark respecting the situation of
places marked upon the two maps, upon information communicated by
others, and not direct observations; it is that the natives are
extremely clever at indicating the direction of places at a greater
or less distance: they are seldom mistaken in this indication; and
they point out with the finger with great accuracy, the direction
which must be taken to go in a straight line to a given spot. This
observation has been made before. When a certain direction was thus
pointed out to M. Caillié, he remarked some particular object on
the line, and applied his compass to it at the first favourable
opportunity. These bearings have been extremely useful to me for
the points situated beyond the route; without this assistance I
should have found it impossible to trace, even tolerably, the
course of the Dhioliba above Djenné.</p>

<h6><a id="cha_a3_4"></a>COMPUTATION OF THE DAYS’ JOURNEYS.</h6>

<p>The geography of countries which have not been explored by
observers furnished with instruments is usually reduced to the
calculations of days’ journeys. What can be more vague or doubtful
than such documents? The most learned discussion (as remarked
above), can only elicit feeble scintillations from them. How are
contradictory accounts to be reconciled? How are common days’
journeys to be distinguished from double days, or even longer
still? It is evident, that itineraries must be examined and
compiled from the number of the hours journeys, and not by the
days, and there would then be a less degree of uncertainty. Should
European travellers themselves compute their lines of march by the
days’ journeys? And how happens it that it is not an established
rule, in exploring distant and unknown countries, to keep an exact
account of the hours and every fraction of time? The journal of M.
Caillié, although he has not rigorously complied with this
condition, at least presents an uninterrupted continuity of marches
measured by time, generally by hours, sometimes by half-hours and
even quarters. But for this persevering (and amidst so many
fatigues truly laudable) attention, positive geography would have
gained very little by these long and toilsome peregrinations.</p>

<p>In a memoir inserted in the eighty-first volume of the
<i>Philosophical Transactions</i>, Major Rennell has fixed the
day’s journey of a caravan heavily laden at sixteen geographical
miles (or minutes of a degree) and one sixth; and that of a light
caravan, at seventeen miles and one third. It appears to me, that
the second of these results is too small, and especially that an
intermediate term should have been established, between the light
and the heavy caravans, for there is a vast difference between the
two extremes. The former certainly advance more than twenty
geographical miles a day, especially, as they are able to continue
their journey longer, that is to say, for a greater number of hours
each day. Then, again, it would be convenient to fix an
intermediate valuation between sixteen and twenty miles, that is to
say, the day’s journey of the medium caravans, if they may be so
called. I find Major Rennell’s appreciation of the first
denomination of days’ journeys confirmed by the experience of the
engineers attached to the French expedition, in crossing the
deserts near Egypt. We estimated the hour’s march at nineteen
hundred toises; eight hours would amount to fifteen miles two
hundred toises, or very nearly sixteen geographical miles; the
hour’s march would thus be established at two miles, or thirty
hours to the degree. In consequence of several calculations much
too long to be reported here, I consider the day’s journey of the
medium caravan to be eighteen geographical miles and four tenths,
the hour being between two miles and two miles and one tenth. I
shall not here take the light caravans into account; these travel
longer, and the progress of each hour is at the same time greater;
but I think it may in many cases be estimated at twenty-two miles,
or ten hours of two miles and two tenths. Persons travelling in
small parties, without reckoning men mounted on horses or
dromedaries, move still quicker.</p>

<p>According to Captain Lyon, the days’ journeys of the caravans
are less than twenty English miles, and above seventeen; that is to
say, more than the short day, and less than the medium. It is not
by the pace either of a pedestrian or of a lightly loaded camel
that the progress of a caravan must be measured, but, on the
contrary, by that of the man or camel bearing the heaviest burden;
for the latter must be waited for by the former, and is perpetually
retarding the march; otherwise the usual pace would be much greater
than that just fixed. Besides, this reduction of the average value
is independent of that which must be allowed for the deviations and
turnings which are often unknown: another source of hesitation and
of error to geographers.</p>

<p>The earlier journeys of M. Caillié on leaving Kakondy afford an
example of the real amount of the day’s journey: the first day, he
advanced twenty-three English miles, the following sixteen miles
and a half; the third eighteen miles; the average rate nineteen
miles and one sixth.<a id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94"
class="fnanchor">[94]</a> The hour’s journey was estimated by him
at three miles only, but the construction of the itinerary proves
that this computation was more than one tenth too small. The result
is twenty one English miles,<a id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> which is very near
eighteen geographical miles and four tenths; all, by my estimation,
medium days, (or days of a medium caravan). Indeed, the small
caravan to which M. Caillié then belonged may be balanced against
these considerations—first, that though small in number it included
a woman; secondly, that all were on foot; thirdly, that all were
loaded. In traversing the desert, the day’s journeys were of twelve
hours and sometimes more;<a id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> but exhaustion, thirst,
and fatigue, prevented both the travellers and camels from keeping
up the same pace as on their first departure, and a mile and a half
an hour is a large allowance for the march.</p>

<p>I ought here to report the opinion of M. Walckenaer, who has
discussed with much sagacity this important geographical
question:<a id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class=
"fnanchor">[97]</a> he fixes at fifteen minutes the amount of a
day’s journey of a caravan heavily loaded; this amount falls short
by only one sixth of that which I have adopted, from our own
experience in Egypt, and which further confirms the opinion of
Major Rennell.</p>

<p>But M. Walckenaer does not estimate the other two denominations
of days’ journeys, those of the medium and of the light caravans. I
shall only remark that the result of his arguments seems to be,
that the real and effective progress is considerably more than 15’,
and about equal to 18’ or 19’: <i>the average of a day’s journey
reduced to measures taken in a straight line upon the map</i>. But
will the diversity of elbows and inflexions, resulting from that of
the obstacles which produce them, allow us to work a uniform
reduction, and to apply a uniform factor to every distance
travelled over? Let us, for instance admit that part of the route
amounts to sixty miles, and that the straight line between these
extremities is forty-eight miles; can the same rule be adopted with
regard to the whole route, which may be three hundred miles or five
times as much? would the total direct line amount to two hundred
and forty miles? The longer the route, the greater should be the
variation in the rate of the reduction. The following table
contains a summary of these observations upon the amount of the
hours’ and days’ marches of caravans, and the different
computations which have been made of them.</p>

<p>I had at first intended to construct separately each of M.
Caillié’s routes, taking into consideration in each particular case
the difficulties of the ground, the composition of the caravans,
and the physical condition of the travellers; but, as it was
impossible to perform this work correctly, it would also have been
useless. Besides, the reflections which I have already made tend to
shew that, by following a uniform plan of reduction from one end of
the route to the other, one must arrive at a result nearly
approaching to the truth.</p>

<p>All that I have hitherto advanced relates solely to that part of
the general map, which represents the space travelled over by M.
Caillié; I have now to speak of the remainder, namely, the
extremity of the map towards the north, and that towards the S. W.
The former portion, or the country of Morocco, has been chiefly
extracted from the fine map of M. Brué,<a id=
"FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class=
"fnanchor">[101]</a> but reduced to much fewer details; we know
that he sought his data in the best Spanish and English maps, and
in the works of Badia, Jackson, Walckenaer, Ritter, &amp;c.;
authorities which furnish excellent materials, but which, the
former especially, must not always be employed without the
assistance of criticism.</p>

<p>The second part, to the south of the Rio-Nuñez, has been drawn
from the <i>Senegambie</i> of M. Dufour, who has skilfully combined
the materials of Major Laing with those of preceding English
travellers: it will be seen by comparing our two maps, that I have
been obliged to differ from him with respect to the situations and
names of several countries. I have also been necessitated, as well
for the sake of perspicuity on a map upon a very small scale, as on
account of uncertainty, to retrench many details. I shall conclude
with the table of geographical positions, forming the foundation of
the general map, independently of the coast of Africa, which is
pretty accurately known.<a id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href=

<h4><a id="cha_s3"></a>§ III</h4>

<p class="center">OF THE NOMENCLATURE.</p>

<p>I shall not here offer to the reader a general list of the names
of towns and villages, or of the different nations, states and
districts visited by M. Caillié during his travels; this duplicate
labour is rendered quite unnecessary by the minute list of the
Itinerary<a id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class=
"fnanchor">[103]</a> contained in this volume, and by the journal
itself, both of which I recommend it to the reader to consult upon
this subject. My object is merely to make some remarks upon the
method of retracing these names and upon a few other relative
points. The nomenclature is so much the more important in the
compilation of African maps, as inattentive travellers frequently
confuse generic appellations with proper names and <i>vice
versa</i>; or they spell the same name in several different ways,
or in writing various names they lose sight of the trifling
differences by which they are distinguished. Hence the faulty
multiplication upon the maps of places which do not exist, and on
the contrary the suppression of many which do. The difficulty is
great, particularly with respect to countries recently explored and
the language of which is unknown. I have chiefly confined myself to
obtaining the names from the mouth of the traveller as his memory
furnished them, and comparing them in his presence with his
journal.</p>

<p>Among other generic terms which have been considered as proper
names, I shall particularize two, on account of the confusion which
they have introduced, and which involves in obscurity some
important geographical questions, namely the situation of a
considerable chain of mountains to the south of the 8th degree of
latitude, and the still unknown outlet of the great central river.
<i>Kong</i>, is the name given, particularly since Mungo Park, to a
great chain of transverse mountains which he reports to have seen
at a distance to his right, when travelling from the Gambia to the
Dhioliba. Now, M. Caillié learnt from the natives that <i>Kong</i>
is a generic word, and that in the Mandingo language it signifies a
mountain; the mountain or chain of mountains in question is
accordingly far from being the only one of its name. I remark also,
that the English traveller in his Mandingo vocabulary explains the
word <i>Kong</i> by <i>head</i>; whence perhaps the signification
of <i>Kong</i>; and himself translates <i>Konko</i> by
<i>hill</i>.<a id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class=
"fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>When the later English travellers had gained intelligence of a
river called <i>Couara</i>, to the west of Saccatou, and of the
river which is near Funda, it was remembered that this name is also
borne by the upper Dhioliba, and these three rivers have been at
once identified; but it appears that <i>Couara</i> is a general
term signifying a river. The inhabitants who in three different
places have been asked the name of the river, not understanding the
question, have answered by the word <i>river</i>. Already had this
confusion taken place a hundred times with the words <i>ba</i>,
<i>bahr</i>, and <i>nil</i>, which also mean <i>river</i>,
<i>running water</i>, <i>great water</i>. There is on the road from
Timé to Djenné a village named Couara, and near it a river of
moderate breadth, called Coraba (or according to my idea
Couara-ba,<a id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class=
"fnanchor">[105]</a>.) It is easy to perceive from the face of the
country, that it is a tributary of the Dhioliba, which was also
reported to M. Caillié; here then is another river of the same
name, or rather another general denomination which confirms the
import of the word <i>Couara</i>, already observed by
travellers.</p>

<p>I have noticed that the Arabic, <i>kha</i> غ, is used every
where, even in the countries where the Arabic language and Islamism
do not prevail: the traveller had expressed it by a blank; I have
written it <i>kh</i> according to the general custom. The slightly
lisping sound ﻎ is used in many central districts, as is a liquid
sound, common also in Senegambia, and which may be written
<i>ghi</i> or <i>dhi</i>. The name of the town of Jenné has been
written Djenné, because the Arabs of the present day write جنع or
جنا; but M. Caillié remarked that the natives pronounce <i>dhi</i>
I am therefore inclined to prefer Dhienné.<a id=
"FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class=
"fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>M. Caillié knows nothing of the Island of Jinbala marked upon
Park’s map, but he was not wholly a stranger to the name; he
mentions a tribe of Jinbalas to the north of Timbuctoo.</p>

<p>I entertain doubts, which time alone can remove; respecting the
names of many places, and I have therefore thought it better to
preserve those names without alteration. I have only omitted, upon
consultation with the traveller, letters which appeared useless to
the pronunciation, or which might create difficulties. The names of
such places as Brahihima no doubt require rectification; the name
of Abrahima, or Ibrahima, &amp;c., are met with in some
travels.</p>

<p>I have suppressed the letter <i>q</i> and almost always the
<i>k</i>, except before <i>e</i> or <i>i</i>, confining myself to
the use of <i>c</i>. The double <i>ss</i> merely expresses the
sound of an initial <i>S</i>. The <i>w</i> and <i>oo</i> of the
English, which M. Caillié acquired the habit of using at
Sierra-Leone, I have expressed upon the maps by <i>ou</i>; the
words in the text have been generally subjected to the same
rules.</p>

<p>On the route to the Tafilet such names as Tamaroc and M-dayara,
&amp;c., occur on account of the use of the initial letters T and M
which announce the vicinity of the Berbers. The wells of Trasas or
Trazah should perhaps be pronounced T-ghazah or T-ghazzah, which
will correspond with the Tegasa or Tegazzah of Leo Africanus<a id=
"FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class=
"fnanchor">[107]</a>. In several words beginning with <i>L</i> as
L-Eksebi, L-Guedea, L-Eyarac, L-Guim, &amp;c., the Arabic article
<i>al</i> appears to me to be joined to the name by contraction, as
in the vulgar pronunciation throughout Northern Africa. The words
beginning with the letter <i>n</i> should perhaps be pronounced
<i>ain</i>, which signifies a source or fountain. I hazard this
conjecture from the presence of wells at such places, and from the
example of Ain-Salah, in the oasis of Touat, which is frequently
written <i>Ensalah</i>, or <i>Nsalah</i>, in a single word. It is
difficult for Europeans to pronounce the guttural ع, and they
frequently leave a blank for it, as well as for the ق and the خ. I
presume, therefore that the names Nzeland, Nyela, &amp;c., stand
for Ain-Zeland, Ain-Yela; but this supposition may perhaps be
refuted by the orthography of the name of Hanalak or (Hen-Alak)
هنالﻜ a place situated upon the route from the country of Galam to
Morocco.</p>

<p>I shall take this opportunity of giving the Arabian orthography
of the names of several places belonging to the space between St.
Louis, Timbuctoo, and Morocco; I am obliged for them, to the Baron
Roger, formerly governor of the Senegal, and who has lately
enhanced, by important publications, the title he had long since
acquired to general esteem, by the improvements of all kinds which
he introduced into that country.</p>

<p>This list contains the names of several Moorish tribes and
colonies of different nations, the orthography of which is
uncertain. It would require very laborious research, and assistance
which will be long unsupplied, to write these names more correctly:
I have contented myself with discarding from the names occurring in
the journal all useless letters, and those which do not accord with
the sound as remembered by our traveller.</p>

<p>Science would be much benefited by the careful examination of
the names engraved on the maps of Northern Africa, without
excepting those recently published, and the indication of the
duplicates and false names, which are real blemishes in works
otherwise of great value; but this labour, even as regards the
countries which belong to my subject, would occupy too much time.
The nomenclature is of more importance than is usually ascribed to
it by the compilers of maps; I consider it one of the fundamental
principles of geography: there are maps which would merit the
appellation of classical if they answered in this respect to their
precision and merit in all others. Two things are wanting to enable
us accurately to fix this nomenclature: the names written by a
native, and the pronunciation collected with great attention<a id=

<h4><a id="cha_s4"></a>§ IV.</h4>

<p class="center">OF SOME RESULTS OF THE TRAVELS OF M. CAILLIÉ.</p>

<p>Of all the results, for which we are indebted to the new
travels, that which most excites curiosity is unquestionably the
knowledge of the city of Timbuctoo; but, perhaps that which is most
important to geography is the course of the great central river.
Although M. Caillié was unable to give information of it beyond
Timbuctoo, he has conferred a real service on science, since he
describes its banks with circumstantial detail from Djenné to that
city, and gives us an idea of its course above Djenné. By crossing
it at Couroussa, and after advancing more than two hundred English
miles farther east, then travelling as far as Djenné on the right
bank, he has furnished reason for concluding that no river parallel
with the Dhioliba exists there, as traced upon the maps. The river,
on the contrary, receives in this quarter pretty numerous
tributaries, which, from their importance, seem to denote a distant
source.<a id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class=
"fnanchor">[112]</a> We perceive from the description that both
banks of the river, a little beyond Bamakou, are very open, and
their declivity gentle, which explains the existence of vast
accumulations of water, of which the Lake Debo or Dhiebou is the
most considerable. Whatever opinion may have been previously formed
of the existence of a lake in this part of Africa, we were utterly
ignorant of its situation, its true name, its form, and extent. The
islets, on which our countryman has thought himself entitled to
bestow names, will perhaps one day prove remarkable points. Their
occupation would suffice to intercept the navigation upwards and
downwards, and by thus rendering their possessor master of the
river to influence the commerce of interior Africa; a commerce,
comprehending on one hand, the gold extracted from the rich mines
of Bouré, and the productions of Kankan, Ouassoulo, and
Fouta-Dhialon, the merchandise of the Mandingoes, and all the
articles of Djenné; on the other, the productions which Timbuctoo
receives from the northern coast, and every thing transported
thither by the Moors from the north and north east.</p>

<p>The observation of the river near Djenné affords a still more
remarkable modification of received opinions; it must now be
acknowledged that Djenné stands on an island, and that this island
is double; which, let me remark, by the way, may serve to explain
many contradictory accounts both of travellers and natives. The new
narrative itself is, I confess, not free from difficulties, I have
consequently only traced with dotted lines the branches of the
river round Djenné. The following results may, at any rate, be
deduced from M. Caillié’s routes by land and water, along the
eastern part, and from the intelligence which he obtained
respecting the western portion; first, that a large branch diverges
near Sego, about forty leagues, (in a direct line), above Djenné;
and that it rejoins the main stream at Isaca, twenty-seven leagues
below, (forming the first or largest island,. including Djenné);
secondly, that near Galia, (or Cou Galia,) is another
communication, having itself two branches, and forming a second or
smaller island, of which Djenné occupies one extremity; another
channel also joins this island with the eastern branch.</p>

<p>This description appears at first sight rather complicated, but
its perplexity will be removed if the tracing dotted on the map be
admitted. The eastern branch could not have been crossed by Mungo
Park, and he knew nothing of it; the same with Dochard. And, as for
the second journey of Park, its narrative breaks off abruptly: it
is probable that the branch which he followed in the first
instance, on which Silla and six other villages beyond Sansanding
are situated, is the same branch, which, according to M. Caillié,
runs from Sego to Isaca; but Djenné must be carried to the right
bank, whereas in the map of Park’s travels it is placed on the
left. This circumstance was already learned from Baron Roger<a id=
"FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class=
"fnanchor">[113]</a>; but the new discoveries perfectly explain
this contradiction, which is merely apparent; for if Djenné is on
the right of the western branch, it is at the same time on the left
of the eastern.</p>

<p>This discussion shews that the immense volume of the waters of
the Dhioliba is still greater than has been supposed. Park, indeed,
who saw only one branch, stood in silent admiration of this
majestic stream; but that which M. Caillié crossed before Djenné
and followed as far as Isaca is not inferior to the other in
importance<a id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class=
"fnanchor">[114]</a>.</p>

<p>The junction of the island with the river, visible from the tops
of the houses in Djenné, was pointed out to M. Caillié. Is it with
the western arm, or with a branch of the eastern? I am disposed to
believe that it is with the latter, the other being at too great a
distance to be within sight. I can say nothing positive of the
island of Jimbala, and which the maps represent between Lake Dibbi
and Cabra, the port of Timbuctoo<a id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>. There is, however, no
reason for doubting its existence, since M. Caillié could not
examine all the windings of Lake Debo or Dhiébou, from which an arm
may diverge to the right, and rejoin the branch which it runs off
to the east near Cabra.</p>

<p>From the travels of M. Caillié we further learn, on the subject
of commercial communications, that the navigation of the Dhioliba
is almost every where practicable; it is navigable as early as
Couroussa, and no doubt yet nearer to its source; there is no
reason to suppose any serious obstacle at Bamakou, although there
appear to be at this place three principal rapids, but not
cataracts. Park navigated it here; the current, by his account (but
on the 22d of August, the season when the river is full,) ran at
the rate of about five knots an hour. Its bed was a mile in width,
and at the point of the rapids twice as much<a id=
"FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class=
"fnanchor">[116]</a>.</p>

<p>The observations which I have made above upon the position of
Timbuctoo<a id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class=
"fnanchor">[117]</a> apply equally to the course of the river. Ever
since the year 1720, the tracing of this course on the maps has
been progressively moving from east to west, drawing nearer and
nearer to the Senegambia and to the west coast of Africa. It
becomes, also, more and more probable that the mountainous space,
which separates these two basons, will be found shorter and more
practicable for the passage both of men and animals. Who knows but
some large tributary to the Dhioliba may run in the close vicinity
of a similar tributary to the Bâfing, or even to the Senegal below
Galam, such as the Red River, or the Baoulima, or the Kokoro, so
that the communication between these two rivers might be
established without much difficulty? Who knows, in short, whether
the progress of civilization may not one day effect the
construction of a canal between such tributaries, suitable for
commercial purposes; and whether we may not then find a navigable
communication opened between the mouths of the Gambia and Senegal
and Sego, Djenné, Timbuctoo, Houssa, and all the large towns by
which the Dhioliba flows?</p>

<p>Even though Europeans should attempt only the land passage
between the two rivers, this would be an enterprise founded on a
more accurate knowledge of the situation and distance of places,
and, if not an immediate consequence, would, at least, be an
indirect result of M. Caillié’s travels on the two banks of the
great river. It is unnecessary for me to add, that if, for want of
positive documents, I should have erred in tracing the itinerary,
the fault will be all my own, and will detract nothing from the
merit of our traveller, or from the gratitude due to him from all
friends and patrons of discoveries.</p>

<p>To continue our examination of the geographical results of M.
Caillié’s travels, I ought not to omit the attention he has paid to
make himself acquainted with the situation and depth of the wells;
a circumstance from which useful inferences may be drawn relative
to the course and distance of the waters: he has not neglected
remarks upon the climate, the periodical rains,<a id=
"FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class=
"fnanchor">[118]</a> and the state of the atmosphere. The learned
will, no doubt, deeply regret that he was unprovided with
instruments for observing and measuring meteorological phenomena:
but it is not on a man’s first travels that these lights can be
obtained; and, besides, none of our readers have forgotten the
perils which attended our countryman in the execution of his
enterprize.</p>

<p>The situations of several known places experience extraordinary
changes in consequence of M. Caillié’s peregrinations, without
mentioning the towns washed by the Dhioliba. Toudeyni, which was
supposed to be 3½ degrees west of the meridian of Timbuctoo, proves
by M. Caillié’s route to be very near the wells of Telig, only 40’
west of that meridian. Is this another place of the same name? I
doubt it: its importance, proved by the description given of it by
our traveller, repels the supposition. A’raouan<a id=
"FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class=
"fnanchor">[119]</a> is inscribed in the maps as a mere station,
with a well of brackish water; but M. Caillié found this a
considerable place, a commercial <i>entrepôt</i>, in a word, an
important town, notwithstanding the partial decay of its
prosperity.</p>

<p>M. Caillié makes us acquainted in the north with a place called
Oualet, at a great distance from the Walet of Mungo Park, and
another of the name of Sala, which confirms the testimony of Arabic
writers; in the south the towns of Teuté, Cagny, or Canny, and
Koung, fifteen days and more south of Timé, that is to say, near
the seventh degree. This account rectifies our notions of the
kingdoms or states east of Fouta-Dhialon, and distinctly points out
the mountainous tracts, the sandy plains, and the fertile
territories enriched by numerous rivers.</p>

<p>We were before uncertain about the district of Bouré; the new
notes enable us to give it on the maps very nearly its true
site.</p>

<p>The large towns in which he resided, such as Timbuctoo,
Fez,<a id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class=
"fnanchor">[120]</a> Djenné, Kankan, are very minutely described,
and were I not unwilling to lengthen this paper, it would be easy
to shew how much he has added in this respect to our information,
and also how many false and exaggerated ideas he has corrected:
this is a merit for which we ought to give him double credit; since
he is, perhaps, of all travellers the one who has dissipated the
greatest number of illusions. Sound minds will feel the more
grateful to him in proportion to the currency formerly gained by
these exaggerations. The lapse of time may, indeed, have effected
actual changes in the importance and population of towns; we must
not, for instance, be surprized at the difference between the
description of Leo and that given at the present day.<a id=
"FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class=
"fnanchor">[121]</a> Who was there but believed, only a short time
since, that Timbuctoo was equal in extent to one of our large
cities, and contained within its walls a population of a hundred
thousand inhabitants, or even from a hundred and fifty to two
hundred thousand? The most moderate computation, says M.
Walckenaer, gives it a hundred thousand inhabitants.<a id=
"FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class=
"fnanchor">[122]</a> The exaggerations of the Arabs have constantly
held the Europeans under the same error, and in the itinerary of
Mohamed-Ebn-Aly Ebn-Foul especially it is said: “This is the
largest city which God has created.”<a id=
"FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class=
"fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>With regard to the account of the mountains of Fouta-Dhialon,
and the means afforded by the descriptions of M. Caillié for
forming an idea of the configuration of the country, or the
relations which exist between the situations of the different
basons, I must refer to what I have said in § II. (articles 2 and
3); I shall also refer to the same for the positions of various
countries, pompously called kingdoms by travellers or writers.</p>

<p>Although he did not receive either from government, or from any
learned societies, those questions or instructions which might have
guided him in his course, M. Caillié has observed much; if he has
not treated his subject very profoundly, if indeed he has but
glanced at it, he has at least opened the road to his
successors.</p>

<p>It is thus that during his travels he has lost no opportunity of
speaking of the manners and customs, of the costume and food, of
the people; of their religious practices and superstitions; of
their commerce and navigation; of their industry, agriculture, and
habitations; of the population of the countries; of the character,
the physiognomy, and the language of the inhabitants; of their
warlike or peaceful habits; in a word, of the whole state of
society amongst these still half barbarous people. The picture of a
flourishing agriculture, a peaceful and industrious population in
the countries of Kankan, Ouassoulo, Baléya, &amp;c., will be read
with peculiar interest. Could it be expected that he should
penetrate deeply into these subjects, or even that he could direct
his attention to them with benefit?</p>

<p>It would be superfluous here to repeat all the new results for
which we are indebted to him, and which make ample amends for the
frequently minute simplicity of his accounts; they well depict the
difficulties of the journey and the precautions which it requires.
Future travellers will not complain of the multiplicity of his
details, monotonous, it is true, but convenient in pointing out to
them the measures necessary to avoid miscarrying in their
enterprize. On this ground M. Caillié will have contributed
usefully to the progress of discovery.</p>

<p>The physical conformation of the various races, and the colour
of their complexion, are most frequently noticed by our traveller.
This is one means of clearing up some questions still enveloped in
great obscurity, for example, the origin of the Fellatas, as they
are called by the latest English travellers. What relation do they
bear to the great nation of Foulahs? We learn from M. Caillié that
the Touariks are established much farther towards the south than
has hitherto been supposed; their camps are seated upon the
Dhioliba, considerably above Timbuctoo. He has also taught us that
they bear a second name, that of Sorgous; above all, he has given
us some very valuable information respecting the tyranny exercised
by this wandering and predatory tribe against the peaceful natives;
the portrait he has drawn of them bears visible marks of truth.</p>

<p>With regard to idioms, it is vexatious that M. Caillié, although
he visited so many tribes, has been able to collect only two
vocabularies. That of Timbuctoo consists of only a hundred and
twenty words. We must regret that it is not more extensive. I have
already said that the words in Denham’s relation agree with him,
but not those of Adams and of Bowdich.</p>

<p>The particulars respecting commerce have been collected with
care. M. Caillié has scarcely ever omitted to point out the native
or foreign commodities which he saw at every market, their price,
and the kind of coin. He confirms the fact that European
merchandise reaches central Africa; goods of English manufacture
were to be seen at Djenné as well as at Saccatou. Upon the commerce
of Bouré in gold the traveller gives us some information which
appears to be equally new and certain, and fit, probably, to direct
the calculations of speculators, or the efforts of the European
governments. We have yet but a vague knowledge of the actual degree
of the riches of the mines of Bouré, and the quantity of gold now
circulating in commerce; but there can be no doubt that it abounds
in this part of Africa. We know for certain that this rich country
is a hundred and twenty or a hundred and forty leagues in a
straight line from the establishments of the Gambia and the
Senegal. If we could, at some future day, open a direct
communication, we should avoid the journey from Bouré to Ségo, from
Ségo to Djenné, thence to Timbuctoo, and afterwards to Morocco,
across the great desert; not only should we thus shorten the road
by at least four hundred leagues in a direct line<a id=
"FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class=
"fnanchor">[124]</a>, but we should escape the cupidity of the
Moors and the Jews, who appropriate the largest part of the
profits, and also the ferocity of the predatory Arabs of the
desert. At a trifling sacrifice, and in a short time this result
might be obtained, if but a small part of those efforts were
consecrated to it, which are absolutely wasted upon less useful
objects. But, whatever the consequence may be, geography and the
genius of discovery will have had the merit of pointing out a
source of wealth to ancient Europe, overcharged with debts and
population, and ready to sink under this double burden, if some new
outlets are not speedily opened to her industry.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<p>If it were possible to doubt the veracity of the traveller; if
it could be supposed that all which has been hitherto said has
still left any uncertainty in the minds of those who, in the first
instance, manifested some incredulity, the results which I have
just recapitulated would remain equally doubtful: it is their
importance which induces me to neglect nothing here which may
dispel doubts, if they still exist. I shall first cite, as a sure
testimony of this veracity, an Arabic manuscript which Lander
received two years ago from the hands of his master Captain
Clapperton, and which M. Salamé translated in London, at the very
time that M. Caillié was completing his enterprise: it is a
description of part of the Soudan. One may read a portion of the
African text, with the new map in one’s hand, for the countries
common to this description and to the itinerary, that is to say, as
far as Timbuctoo. I will even add that it would have been
completely unintelligible to me, without the assistance of this
map<a id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class=
"fnanchor">[125]</a>. The alteration in the names of places does
not prevent their being recognized; for many of the differences, it
appears evident to me, arise only from carelessness in copying. I
have made an extract from this curious document, which was
accompanied by a map of the Kouara, traced by the hand of the
secretary or amanuensis of the Sultan Bello. I place, according to
geographical order, the different parts of the description,
extracted as I have said above.</p>

<p>“The route from Sakkatou to Masera crosses first a tributary to
the Kouara, and afterwards that river itself.</p>

<p>“The Touara flows from south to north, thence to the east, and
afterwards returns to the south.</p>

<p>“It is formed of two arms, the one, called <i>Balio</i>, <i>the
black river</i>, coming from the Fouta-Djalo; the other, called
<i>Raniou</i>, <i>the white river</i>, coming from Ségo<a id=
"FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class=
"fnanchor">[126]</a>.</p>

<p>“At their junction it takes the name of Couarra, according to
the secretary.</p>

<p>“Upon the first is a large island containing the town of
Djeri.</p>

<p>“Many streams fall into the river on the left side.</p>

<p>“Beyond is the lake Djebou.</p>

<p>“Timbuctoo is at the farthest turn of the river: Kabara is half
a day’s journey from that city.</p>

<p>“Masera is beyond the branch which comes from Ségo.</p>

<p>“The Touariks occupy the country adjoining Timbuctoo to the
north, &amp;c.</p>

<p>I pass over in silence the other places unconnected with the
route of M. Caillié, or which he has not mentioned.</p>

<p>This account appeared at first very obscure; but by reading,
with me, Massina instead of Masera, and Djené (or Djenné, instead
of Djeri), every thing is explained.</p>

<p>It is easy to confound a <i>noun</i> without a point ﻥ with a ﺭ
<i>re</i>. A similar error, I think, has been committed in the name
of <i>Ba-niou</i> which has been read <i>Raniou</i> taking a
<i>be</i> without a point ﺑ for a ﺭ <i>re</i>.</p>

<p>The word <i>Dombari</i>, a mountain, represented upon the map of
the Fellata writer, ought, upon the principle already laid down, to
be read in two words <i>Oun-bari</i>.</p>

<p>M. Caillié having informed us that the situation of Djenné is in
an island, it will be immediately recognised in that of Djéri,
actually situated at seven days’ journey from Ségo. In like manner,
the arm, which separates in the environs of Ségo, says M. Caillié,
and rejoins the western branch at Isaca, explains the Balio and the
Banio, which meet, (according to the Fellata), below Djéri (or
Djenné). Our traveller, not having inquired the names of these
branches of the river, could not be acquainted with them. Masera is
here, like Massina, to the west of Djenné: I remarked that, in
travelling from Timé to Djenné, M. Caillié neither saw nor heard of
the mountain or the town of Ounbari, nor of the road leading to
Saccatou.</p>

<p>The lake Debo or Debou is here placed as it was seen by M.
Caillié, between Timbuctoo and the confluence of the two branches
(at Isaca); it is called in the Arabic description Djebou. The name
of this great lake is doubtless written جبو, and I suppose that in
this word, the ﺟ is pronounced <i>dhi</i>, as at the Senegal. On
this subject, I remark that, according to M. Caillié, the name of
the town of Djenné is pronounced, in that country, in a peculiar
manner, expressed here by <i>Dhienné</i>.</p>

<p>The same is the case with the name of Fouta-Dhialon which the
English translator, after the Fellata, writes Fouta-Djalo<a id=
"FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class=
"fnanchor">[127]</a>. In studying the Arabic nomenclature of the
places bordering on the Senegal, this observation has appeared to
me to be more and more confirmed; and it must by analogy be
applicable to the neighbouring countries. The Marabouts had only
the letter <i>djim</i> ﺝ at their disposal for expressing this
liquid sound, which is of a peculiar nature, intermediate between
the English <i>th</i> and the Arabic <i>dj</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>marigots</i> observed by M. Caillié on the left bank of
the stream, correspond with the four rivers or canals belonging to
Masera or Masina.</p>

<p>Kabera appears here to be placed beyond Timbuctoo (coming from
Djenné): the place in question is perhaps distinct from Cabra; or
Timbuctoo may be a little farther west of Cabra than has been
supposed. M. Caillié in going to this city went due north by the
compass, which places it only 17° west of Cabra.</p>

<p>With regard to <i>Baniou</i>, <i>White River</i>, it should be
remembered that M. Caillié also translates in the same manner the
word <i>Bagoé</i>, the name of a considerable tributary of the
river running from <i>Teuté</i>, very far south, but falling in on
the right bank, whereas the Baniou is on the left: there is
therefore a difference both in the name and situation. <i>Goé</i>
(and <i>koué</i>, according to Mungo Park) certainly signify
<i>white</i> in Mandingo. But the words <i>niou</i> and <i>lio</i>,
I cannot find in any vocabulary of Northern Africa, with the
meaning of <i>white</i> and <i>black</i>. In Wolof, <i>moul</i>
signifies <i>black</i>.</p>

<p>The Banimma of the maps cannot flow parallel with the great
river, as I have explained above<a id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>.</p>

<p>It would not be uninteresting to compare with this draught the
pretended map of Bello himself, which Clapperton has given in his
first travels<a id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129"
class="fnanchor">[129]</a>. Five or six sites only are connected
with my subject; Djenné is here, as in the other, placed between
two branches of the river, (a fresh point of conformity with our
traveller) and the Massina is separated from it by the western
branch. There again the <i>r</i> is substituted for the <i>n</i>;
(and I presume for the same reason) for it is there spelt Jesni or
Jenri, and Mashira<a id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130"
class="fnanchor">[130]</a>.</p>

<p>For want of room, Bello has placed Sego and Masina, much too
near together, as well as Fouta and Djenné. The city of Timbuctoo
(written Tonbaktou) is not less misplaced by the august geographer;
but he has marked between it and Mashira (Massina) a large
tributary or off-branch: this is probably one of the four rivers
which his secretary has indicated in the same space, and one of the
<i>marigots</i>, the outlet of which was seen by M. Caillié<a id=
"FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class=
"fnanchor">[131]</a>. Thus the only two <i>native maps</i> (if they
may be so called) which we possess, and the recent descriptions of
two Africans, all confirm the discoveries of M. Caillié, who was
entirely unacquainted with them.</p>

<p>A corroborative testimony is that of Park himself. Similar names
will be found in the two narratives for certain indigenous
productions and for several instruments employed in the arts. The
Mandingo words and names are either the same or analogous in the
two narratives.</p>

<p>In a preceding article, I think I have sufficiently shewn the
agreement of M. Caillié’s observations with those of other
distinguished travellers, Mollien, Watt, and Winterbottom, and
Major Laing. The particulars of Major Laing’s death collected by
our traveller at Timbuctoo, and afterwards on the very theatre of
the catastrophe, so far from contradicting those obtained either by
the English Consul at Tripoli, or by the governor of the Senegal,
confirm all the important circumstances of both<a id=
"FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class=
"fnanchor">[132]</a>.</p>

<p>We did not learn from the first travels of Clapperton the name
of the prince reigning at Timbuctoo; it was even imagined that the
supreme authority resided at that period in a female; and when M.
Caillié informed us that the supreme chief of Timbuctoo was named
<i>Osman</i>, we could not reconcile this report with those which
had preceded it: but we have now letters from Major Laing himself,
received since the return of our countryman, one of which dated
from Timbuctoo, the 21st of September, 1826, reveals the name of
the prince then reigning, and this name is also <i>Osman</i><a id=
"FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class=
"fnanchor">[133]</a>.</p>

<p>In the same letter, Major Laing states the circumference of the
city at four miles; this account confirms the small population
assigned to it by M. Caillié. He adds that he has collected
documents in abundance relating to Timbuctoo. If we may rely on the
account of a Moor from Saint Louis, the <i>books</i> of the Major
are at the disposal of a certain Saleh, son of the Iman of
Timbuctoo; and according to another they are in the hands of the
Touariks. Time will in all probability produce some of the
documents, the only consolation for so deplorable a loss.</p>

<p>The same accuracy appears in M. Caillié’s observations
respecting the journeys, if we admit as a fair specimen those which
concern countries whose geography is known; thus the distance from
Fez to Arbate by Mequinaz agrees with the itinerary of M. Caillié,
at the rate of three miles an hour.</p>

<p>So many motives of confidence and interest sufficiently
recommend the accuracy of the travels, and consequently
authenticate the results I have above deduced; yet the history of
the enterprize itself will, if possible, increase this effect. The
inclination of Réné Caillié for travels of discovery early
announced his vocation. From the moment of his second landing at
Senegal, he employed himself in acquiring a familiarity with the
language of the Moors.<a id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> He talked of nothing but
penetrating into the interior of Africa, the object of all his
thoughts; his resources became exhausted, yet he refused every
other occupation, every other mission. This fixed impression was
regarded as a mania; nothing could shake his purpose, not even the
insults which his Moorish costume drew upon him from the negroes;
he was content to be considered by them as an idiot, and almost an
object of derision. The want of sufficient support having obliged
him to take another course, he set out for Sierra-Leone; there he
remained the period necessary for collecting some resources, and
soon quitted it for Rio-Nuñez: thence he announced to a friend at
St. Louis (in April 1827) his departure for the interior. He was
supposed to be lost, and nearly forgotten like so many other
victims, when, at the expiration of eighteen months, he suddenly
appeared at the further extremity of Africa, triumphant over every
obstacle; like an expert swimmer, who, having plunged into the
bosom of a broad stream, after a long interval unexpectedly appears
on the opposite bank, while his friends are already lamenting his
loss as certain.</p>

<p>Scarcely had he quitted the banks of the Rio-Nuñez and entered
upon this new career of difficulty and danger, when he at once
displayed a consummate prudence, and far above his years: as
skilful in appreciating obstacles as he was firm in encountering
them, his embarrassments increased at every step; but his sagacity
constantly suggested the means of extricating himself from every
new perplexity. Had he not possessed this just estimate of his
difficulties and resources, united with a fortitude not to be
shaken, he could not have concluded, perhaps not have commenced,
his enterprize. How ingenious was the fiction he invented to obtain
the confidence of these numerous tribes! This thread, slender as it
was, served every where for his guidance and protection. He rightly
supposed that the fame of the French expedition to Egypt had spread
over Northern Africa: it was natural that a child carried off from
its parents at the age of three years, and transported into the
heart of France, should be but ill versed in his mother-tongue;
equally so that good Musulmans should congratulate him on his
return to his country by the most direct line, although he was
supposed to be destitute of resources. Now this line must
inevitably conduct him beyond the great river: afterwards
manifesting a desire of repairing to Alexandria by sea, it was
necessary to return to the river and embark on it, and thus his
arrival at Timbuctoo was accomplished with certainty; having
attained this object, he must naturally seek the readiest and
surest means of reaching some place occupied by Europeans, and the
caravan of Tafilet offered an opportunity that he could not
hesitate to seize.</p>

<p>I shall not advert to all his misfortunes at Timé, and during
the journey, nor to his perils at Tangier, when already within
sight of his haven; but with what intelligence and courage must he
have been endowed to resist and triumph over so many enemies. It
was necessary to avoid the most trifling error; a single one would
have infallibly proved his destruction.</p>

<p>Few are acquainted with the history of the unfortunate Antonio
Piloti, a Spaniard, who took refuge in Morocco in consequence of
the political events of 1811. After having assumed the Moorish
dress, and habituated himself to the language, he succeeded in
enrolling himself amongst the Emperor of Morocco’s guards.
Incessantly occupied with the project of going by this means to
Timbuctoo, he secretly offered his services to the French consul,
M. Sourdeau; he solicited the protection of the French government:
the Consul had ascertained that he combined all the qualifications
essential to success, yet his offers were rejected. Neverthless
Piloti daily prosecuted his preparations for the journey: nothing
it should seem could have prevented his success, since he would
have set out under the disguise of a Moor, and returned with a
caravan of Moors. In the absence of direct assistance from France,
he was furnished with instructions by M. Delaporte, our
vice-consul, and from a member of the Geographical Society, who was
on the point of sending to him some instruments, when he was
suddenly implicated in the political movements of the court of
Morocco. The Moors and Jews, always intriguing, suspected some
secret designs on his part, and denounced him as belonging to the
party opposed to the prince. His trial was summary, and Piloti was
beheaded. Such is the jealous distrust manifested by the mercenary
race, against any stranger, who, making himself acquainted with the
localities, should attempt to deprive them of any portion of their
commerce with the interior. M. Caillié, ignorant of this adventure,
was more fortunate; he did not continue long enough exposed to the
suspicions of the Moors, or by prudence and sacrifices he contrived
to escape the effects of them.</p>

<p>On the first arrival of the letters which I received from M.
Delaporte and M. Caillié himself, I entertained some doubts of the
authenticity of his narrative, and I immediately arranged some
questions by way of trial, on the language spoken at Timbuctoo, the
customs of the country, its natural productions, the nomenclature
and distance of places, &amp;c.: but meanwhile I attentively
compared the two letters, and found the result so conformable to
the most established notions of science, that I determined to
publish on that very day the news of the journey to Timbuctoo. Many
were incredulous; I expected it. I requested the traveller, who in
the interval had landed at Toulon, to commit to paper without delay
his recollections respecting the questions which I held in
readiness for his arrival, but to which he had beforehand in a
great measure replied. The very day of his arrival he submitted to
my inspection a journal of his travels complete, and continued from
the 19th of April 1827 to the 21st of September 1828, modestly
observing: “I do not know whether I can answer all your questions,
but here are my notes.” He then shewed me part of the original
notes, written in pencil, on the spot, and the narrative written
and completed during his residence at Tangier and in quarantine,
though suffering under a high fever. He also shewed me the pieces
of cord with which he had measured the meridian shadow at Timbuctoo
and in other places, some fragments of plants brought from the
interior, the vocabularies, and some simple sketches of the town of
Timbuctoo. If after such testimony I could retain any doubts, the
construction of all the routes of the traveller, which I drew up on
the following day, would have effectually dispelled them, for I
discovered that the observations were continued without any
interruption, and that the whole produced a result agreeing with
the data already acquired.</p>

<p>It remained that the learned Geographical Society should share
my conviction, an additional success for which M. Caillié had not
long to wait;<a id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135"
class="fnanchor">[135]</a> and he obtained a brilliant recompense
which he had amply merited. This example will restore confidence to
minds discouraged by so many fatal catastrophes; and will inflame
the zeal of those who are actuated by a desire for glory and the
advancement of geographical science.</p>

<h4><a id="cha_s5"></a>§ V.</h4>

<p class="center">OF THE COURSE OF THE DHIOLIBA ABOVE AND BELOW
TIMBUCTOO.</p>

<p>The attentive reader who may have patiently followed me through
the preceding pages, will, no doubt, have remarked the new and
principal fact which results from M. Caillié’s observations; the
division of the Dhioliba in the environs of Sego into two branches
equally broad and deep, and the existence of a large island. It
elucidates the description of Mungo Park, and reconciles him with
our traveller; it explains the contradictions between the
situations assigned to the same towns by different travellers,
sometimes on the right, and sometimes on the left of the river, and
finally it enlarges our ideas of the advantages of navigation in
the interior of the Soudan. This fact also accounts for the great
collection of waters which forms the lake Dhiebou or Debo, because
many considerable branches which separate from the western arm
unite again with the main stream beyond the tributary which falls
into it at Isaca; and the want of declivity in the direction of
this junction is the cause of the stagnation of the waters.</p>

<p>It would appear that the river has different names which change
with its course. Called at its source <i>Tombia</i>, <i>Ba</i>,
<i>Dhioliba</i>, &amp;c., it retains the latter name as far as
Sego, where or in the environs it divides; if we may trust the
description of the amanuensis of Bello, the left arm is called
<i>Baniou</i>, and the right <i>Balio</i>, and after the junction
it is called only <i>Couara</i>. But M. Caillié never once heard
that the river, which he reached at Galia, and upon which he
navigated thirty days, had different names; perhaps because he did
not inquire. He only saw a river, Couaraba, which falls into the
right branch, but very far to the south. I think then that if the
stream is called <i>Couara</i> below Isaca, it is only because the
term is generic and signifies a <i>river</i>.</p>

<p>I might stop here and leave it to the reader to draw other
consequences from the new observations. But the question of the
outlet of this stream is so closely connected with my subject, that
the reader would have a right to complain if in this work he found
neither information nor opinion upon it. It is universally inquired
what becomes of this immense collection of water below Timbuctoo;
it is at least necessary to exhibit in a few words the different
opinions at present current upon this subject.</p>

<p>The most ancient identifies this river with the Nile of Egypt.
It does not appear that the partisans of this opinion had any other
foundation than the pretended unanimous reports of blacks, Arabs,
and natives. Thus without considering the physical conditions, or
taking account of insurmountable obstacles, they maintained as a
fact, that the waters which had their rise in the heights of the
Soulimana, that is to say at an elevation of from fourteen to
fifteen hundred feet, reached the Mediterranean after a course of
two thousand leagues. But, what is perhaps still more strange, this
notion rested wholly upon the equivocal interpretation of a word,
or as we may express it in plain English upon a pun; the word
<i>Nile</i> or <i>Nil</i> is generic. In saying that the Dhioliba
joins the Nile, the Africans mean no more than it communicates with
some other <i>great water</i>, whether it falls into it, or whether
it receives it, (for this distinction of arm or tributary is very
important). When therefore the Arabs say that the Dhioliba
communicates with the <i>Nile</i> or the <i>Bahi</i>, they
understand thereby either a great river, or a sea, and this may be
an inland sea as well as the Ocean. This opinion that the Dhioliba
empties itself into the <i>Nile</i> of Egypt, though it was
supported only a few years since by a learned writer, appears to be
now altogether abandoned.</p>

<p>But this is not the case with the opinion of those who, like
Major Rennell, consider the central lake as the outlet of the
river. Before the discovery of the lake Tchâd by the English
travellers, the existence of this inland sea might have been
doubted, the evidence of it was so vaguely attested. This opinion,
however supported by probability, is nevertheless liable to two
objections: first, that upon the whole western coast of the lake is
found the mouth of only one inconsiderable river, the source of
which is at no great distance in the E. S. E.; secondly, that the
town of Boussa, to which Park navigated upon the Dhioliba, is now
known by the second journey of Clapperton, and that it is very far
to the S. E. of Timbuctoo.</p>

<p>With regard to the first objection, it may not prove a serious
difficulty, because recent travellers have not followed the river
Yéou, which falls into lake Tchad; they have left it at a certain
distance from the lake, and it is very possible, that that which
they have seen farther on may have been only a tributary to the
former. As to the second objection, it might be more important if
it were certain that the Dhioliba runs in <i>a single bed</i> from
Timbuctoo to Saccatou and to Boussa; but there is nothing to prove
this. Continuing eastwards, towards the central lake, it may send
out a branch to Boussa; and this division would account for the
Yéou consisting of but an inconsiderable body of water.<a id=
"FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class=
"fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>Reichard was one of the first who imagined that the Dhioliba may
run into the Gulf of Guinea. This hypothesis has for some time past
assumed a certain degree of probability, to which the opinions of
the later English travellers, Clapperton and Major Laing,<a id=
"FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class=
"fnanchor">[137]</a> have added much weight. They differ, however,
respecting the outlet of the river: the one preferring the river
Benin (or Formosa), with Reichard<a id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>; the other, but with
much less probability, the Rio-Volta. The objection always raised
to this hypothesis is the great height of the mountains called
<i>Kong</i>. To reach the sea, the river must cross them; but it
may not be absolutely impossible that there should exist an opening
in them deep enough to admit of its passage. Another difficulty
arises from the small declivity of these waters: but I will here
make an observation on this subject. The actually known course of
the Dhioliba, from its source as far as Timbuctoo, is about three
hundred and sixty leagues: it issues from Mount Loma, at a height
of nearly sixteen hundred English feet above the sea, or less than
five hundred metres. The velocity observed by M. Caillié leads to
the belief, that the average inclination from Djenné and also from
Bamakou to Timbuctoo is two thirds of a metre to a league:
Timbuctoo would stand, according to this datum only, at a height of
two hundred and sixty metres; but it is very probable, that the
inclination is much greater from Mount Loma to Bamakou than it is
below this latter point, which would lower the position of
Timbuctoo at least to two hundred and thirty metres, taking the
fall of the first part at only a metre for a league. But this
quantity would greatly exceed that supposed by Capt. Beaufort, who,
after having observed the elevation of Elimané, conceived Timbuctoo
to be upon the same level, that is to say, eighty-four metres above
the sea.<a id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class=
"fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>Now, from Timbuctoo to the mouth of the river of Benin,
following the course of the waters (as it is traced by the
partisans of this opinion), the distance is not less than four
hundred and sixty leagues. Thus, in the second part of its course,
the river would have a total declivity of 230 metres, or 0,51 metre
to a league. It is known that the Seine has an inclination of 0,72
metre to a league; the Mississipi, 0,84 metre; the Rio-Apure, 0,92
metre, &amp;c. but others have a much less fall, such as the Wolga,
the Missouri, the Senegal, &amp;c., which have one of 0,50
only;<a id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class=
"fnanchor">[140]</a> so that, strictly speaking, the above
inclination is sufficient.</p>

<p>According to a fourth opinion, the river, on reaching the
<i>Kong</i> mountains, makes an elbow to the left and runs
eastward, by Djacoba and Adamowa to Chary, and thence to lake Tchad
into which it discharges itself. It is here that the objection of
the want of sufficient inclination applies: how can it be admitted,
that the river, after passing Funda, where it would scarcely have
an elevation of fifty metres<a id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> above the sea,
(supposing it to be the river of Timbuctoo which flows to Funda),
can run on to lake Tchad, three hundred and fifty leagues farther,
through a country represented by all accounts as mountainous? But
this, even, is not the greatest difficulty.</p>

<p>It is hardly conceivable that any geographer should have
admitted an hypothesis, the absurdity of which must have been
manifest upon the slightest reflection. The height of lake Tchad
has been ascertained: it is nine hundred and twenty French feet
above the level of the sea, or something less than three hundred
metres; it cannot, therefore, receive the waters which flow to
Funda.</p>

<p>The course of this river east of Funda must be reversed, and the
supposed elbow converted into a tributary: we shall then probably
approach the truth. Major Denham was the first to conceive this
easterly turn of the river, running north of the great chain of
mountains, and falling at a great distance into the central lake;
he had been assured that a communication existed between this river
and lake Tchad by the Chary. How is it that the physical
impossibility of this course did not occur to him?</p>

<p>A very simple consideration appears to afford a solution of this
difficulty, namely, the existence of a lake in an elevated point of
the Mandara chain, giving rise both to the Chary and the river
which flows by Adamowa and Djacoba. The reports made to Major
Denham demonstrate the importance of this stream, which is
sufficiently proved by its extent; but, why, without ocular
testimony, did he imagine its course to be easterly? If the negroes
did not inform him that it ran to the west, neither did they state
the contrary. Let us admit the westerly direction: a certain
communication will then exist also between the Couara and the
Chary; only, after having descended a current southwards, we must
ascend another eastward, and thence redescend northwards, into the
central lake. This is the most plausible theory I can devise upon
Major Denham’s opinion; this is nearly the case with the White Nile
and the Misselad, both taking their rise in one of the lakes of
Gebel-Koumri. Upon this system, the Couara will continue, after the
confluence, to flow southwards, and fall into the sea near the
coast of Benin.</p>

<p>A fifth opinion has been recently broached by the English
General Sir Rufane Donkin;<a id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> the summary of which is
that the Niger crosses the Wangarah, enters the valley of
Ouadi-el-Ghazel, formed by the continuation of the Misselad, and
thence runs into the Mediterranean (in the great Syrtis) by a
subterranean channel under the sands of Bilmah; and moreover that
the Niger rises near the Gulph of Guinea, instead of running
towards it. This rather extraordinary opinion has met with
adversaries, at which we need not be surprised, even after having
read the arguments on which the dissertation is founded. I do not
therefore think it necessary to discuss it here; neither shall I
enter into the complicated notions, upon the courses of the central
river, hazarded by the English traveller Bowdich on very vague
information; and I shall be cautious not to offer an additional
hypothesis of my own respecting this problem, still full of
obscurity. On what basis can an entire and complete system be
founded while even the names of the central regions are unknown to
us, and our researches into the physical geography of these vast
tracts are yet in their infancy; when, in short, the papers of
Major Laing, should they be recovered, may at once throw strong
light on these chasms in science?<a id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> It may however be
affirmed, and I think with certainty, that the rivers called
Dhioliba and Couara neither join the Egyptian Nile, nor contribute
one drop to its waters; I think besides that, if the Couara of
Funda actually is the continuation of the Dhioliba, flowing to Sego
and Timbuctoo, and falls into the Gulph of Guinea, there is nothing
to hinder it from throwing off a branch to the east, which may have
its outlet in the Yeou and the central lake: this would be the
branch seen by M. Caillié before he reached Timbuctoo, and which
our traveller followed, the other being on his right flowing
east-south-east; and there is no proof that the whole of the former
rejoins the latter. The great lake Tchad, or central sea, would
then not be the general receptacle of the Dhioliba, but only one of
its outlets.</p>

<h4><a id="chb_3"></a>OBSERVATIONS ON THE MANDINGO AND THE
KISSOUR.</h4>

<hr class="chap">

<p class="center">Note.1.—<em>Upon the Mandingo.</em></p>

<p>It appears that the syllable <i>fé</i> is the sign of the
preposition <i>upon</i>, <i>in</i>, or <i>with</i>, and that this
preposition follows the substantive; examples <i>tafé</i>, on the
fire; <i>nefé</i>, with me; <i>sofé</i>, in the village;
<i>silafé</i>, on the road, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Negation is expressed by <i>até</i> or <i>té</i>; yet there are
many words of a negative sense, preceded only by <i>a</i> or
<i>am</i>.</p>

<p>The syllable <i>ka</i> seems to be used for the purpose of
expressing <i>to be</i>, whether positively or interrogatively.</p>

<p>The word <i>will</i> or <i>to will</i> is not in the vocabulary;
but the phrases present an example of the use of the word
<i>abegue</i> in this sense. Besides, the vocabulary of Timbuctoo
gives <i>abegue</i> for I will.</p>

<p>The relatives <i>who</i>, <i>which</i>, <i>what</i>, are neither
indicated in the vocabulary nor in the phrases; but <i>tiez</i>
stands for <i>what</i>, in the phrase, <i>what do you call
that?</i></p>

<p>I have added the word <i>name</i>, which was not in the
vocabulary, from the three phrases, <i>tiez tokhodi</i>, <i>aman
tokholo</i>, <i>atokho</i>....</p>

<p class="center">Note 2.—<em>On the Kissour.</em></p>

<p>It appears, by several short phrases in Kissour, that the word
<i>makin</i> corresponds with the relative <i>who</i>, or
<i>what</i>; <i>neare</i> with the word <i>name</i>; <i>ouri</i> or
<i>neouri</i>, with to <i>desire</i>. I have inserted in the
vocabulary some other words furnished by the phrases.</p>

<p>The vocabulary of Major Denham is composed of sixty-seven words,
without the numbers; M. Caillié’s of ninety. Forty words only are
common to both; but the two correspond almost throughout; it is the
same with the numerals: this fact is remarkable. On the contrary,
as I have said, the words of Adams, Bowdich and Lyon, differ

<h4><a id="chd_2"></a>PLANTS.</h4>

<p>In addition to the explanation of the engravings, I will say a
few words respecting several fragments of plants collected in the
environs of Kakondy (Rio-Nuñez), which botanists have considered
either too ill-preserved or too incomplete for engraving. M.
Caillié made sketches of some which appeared equally unfit to be
committed to the graver.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Native name</em>. <span class="sc">Saulé-Kémé</span>. The
blossom has ten stamina, two of them large and of a deep yellow,
and three smaller supported by a very fine and twisted fibre; the
flower deserves attention for its beauty; it appears fit to adorn a
garden; it emits a sweet and agreeable odour; its colour is a light
yellow; the pistil is green. The shrub which produces it, grows on
a bush to the height of eight or ten feet. It has not been seen in
fruit.</p>

<p>The sketch traced by M. Caillié, and the little sample which he
gathered, shew the nature of the foliage; it is of the leguminous
kind: the leaves are oval, rounded; the flower in bunches, the
pedicle furnished with stipulæ, the anthers bifid, the style long
and filiform.</p>

<p>According to the learned M. Kunth, who has obligingly examined
this and the two following specimens, this plant is no other than
acassi a <i>Cassia fistula</i>, of a species of which, it is well
known, there are very lofty trees.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><em>Name unknown</em>. The newly opened blossom is white; it
turns afterwards yellow: the perfume it exhales is extremely
agreeable. The shrub is nine or ten feet high; I at first took this
flower for that of an American gourd. (<i>M. Caillié’s
notes.</i>)</p>

<p>The leaf is lanceolated and pointed; the corolla is large,
monopetalous, funnel-shaped, with a long tube, having seven great
divisions, oval and very deep; the calyx appears to have eight
divisions; the fruit is ovoid; the stalk is furnished with long
blunt thorns. This plant appears to belong to the <i>rubia</i>
family.</p>

<p>M. Kunth considers it as a species resembling the <i>gardenia
thunbergia</i>, but differing in having rough and smaller
leaves.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><em>Name unknown</em>.—The blossoms and leaves are hairy; the
petals blue; the plant is herbaceous. It is with its root that the
Landamas make the purgative drink which they call <i>jinjindhi</i>;
this root resembles the small cassava. (<i>M. Caillié’s
notes.</i>)</p>

<p>The fruit and stalk are also hairy. The leaves are pointed oval,
of a beautiful green, marked with four longitudinal borders, and
covered on one side with flat short and very glossy hairs. The
flowers have five petals, the form of which is oval and pointed;
the hairs of the calyx are long. This plant belongs to the
<i>melastomæa</i>. This genus is known to be very numerous in
America; but it had not previously been found in Africa.</p>

<p>M. Kunth considers it as a species of <i>rhexia</i>, differing
from those of Africa, published by M. de Beauvoir; but it is too
incomplete to admit of its species being determined.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h4>MISCELLANEOUS NOTES.</h4>

<ul class="upper-alpha">
<li>
<p><em>Hibiscus</em>.—In the environs of Djenné, the traveller saw
an <i>hibiscus</i>, of which cords are made as with hemp; these
cords serve for the construction of the canoes. At the Senegal
there is also an <i>hibiscus</i> fit for this operation. It was
found, I believe, on the banks of the Gambia, where it is known by
the name of <i>hibiscus cannabinus</i>. In the construction of
canoes, two trunks of trees are united and firmly bound together
with the cords in question.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><em>Cotton plant</em>.—M. Caillié observed, on the road from
Djenné, a species of cotton plant which he believes to be annual.
This statement has been doubted: yet in Egypt there is also an
herbaceous cotton-plant, and there is no reason against the
admission of the fact.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><em>The Bombax</em> is a tree known in Senegambia; its fruit
produces a very fine and glossy silk, capable of being
manufactured. M. de Beaufort sent over samples of it. The narrative
shews that this beautiful tree is also very common south of
Senegambia.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><em>Bark</em>, yielding a beautiful red dye. M. Caillié has not
made us acquainted with the nature of the tree that bears this
bark, which on being merely washed yields a red colour. But the
discovery would be easily made, since the tree grows not far from
the French possessions.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><em>Mimosa</em>.—M. Caillié saw several large species of
mimosas; it is a subject of regret that he has not described each.
One of the most spreading is the <i>nédé</i>, a beautiful tree,
with a globular flower of a red colour borne on a very long
pedicle; the foliage is very delicate. The natives eat the pulp by
which the seed is surrounded.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><em>Balanites</em>.—This tree is one of the most common along
the whole of M. Caillié’s route, from Kakondy to Djenné. The
inhabitants extract an oil from it.</p>

<p>The <i>Balanites Ægyptiaca</i>. (<span class=
"sc">Delile</span>)<a id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166"
class="fnanchor">[166]</a> is not the only tree common to this
country and Egypt; the same may be said of many other natural
productions, and of plants and animals in general. This remark has
been frequently made since the publication of the travels of the
French in Egypt, and the discoveries in natural history made in
Senegambia. The similarity of the two countries in certain
respects, a great river annually overflowing, a very high
temperature, the vicinity of the desert, and other circumstances
seem, at the first glance, sufficiently to explain this
identity.</p>

<p>But I do not believe that in this case the difference of the
latitude has been observed. The mean parallel of Egypt is about
27°½.; that of Senegambia 13; difference 14°½. If the height of the
temperature is important, as it undoubtedly is, amongst the causes
which encourage to a certain extent some species of vegetables and
animals, it must be concluded that Egypt is the warmest region of
northern Africa in proportion to its latitude. The mean temperature
of Egypt is, actually higher than that of the Senegal: this was far
from being suspected prior to the observations of the Egyptian
Institute; and Baron Humboldt did not introduce his Memoir on the
isothermal lines till after having long retained doubts, which the
tables of Messrs. Nouet and Coutelle dispelled. Thus, the
isothermal line of Egypt would make a large angle with the equator.
Mount Atlas is too far distant to explain the fact; the mountains
of Senegambia are not sufficiently elevated; we are, therefore, led
to seek the cause in the vicinity of the Sahara, the vast radiation
of which must incessantly attract the lower strata of a warmer
atmosphere, such as that of Senegal and of the more remote
districts, on account of their nearly juxta-equatorial position: so
that the mean temperature of Senegambia would, but for this cause,
be much higher than it is, and far higher than that of Egypt.</p>

<p>These considerations leave room to regret that we have no
meteorological observations made at Timbuctoo, not only on the
thermometer and barometer, but also upon the state of the heavens
and the prevailing winds; such no doubt exist among the papers of
Major Laing, as may be concluded from the terms of his letter,
written from that city, the 21st of September, 1826<a id=
"FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class=
"fnanchor">[167]</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><em>Doum</em>.—The Doum Palm-tree, (<i>corypha thebaica</i>
<span class="sc">Delile</span>); belongs to Upper Egypt. It is
remarkable that a tree of this species exists in the city of
Timbuctoo; it is the only one, the other trees of the place being
all <i>balanites</i>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><em>Lotus</em> (<i>nymphæa</i>.).—This again is a plant common
to Egypt. In the latter country the root only is now eaten; but the
negroes, like the ancient Egyptians, use both the root and the
fruit.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><em>Thistle of the Desert</em>.—This, according to the
description given of it by M. Caillié, appears to be the
<i>hedysarum alhagi</i>, (<span class="sc">Linn.</span>) a well
known plant, and which constitutes the provender of the famished
camels; in spite of its rough prickles, they eat it with delight in
traversing the desert.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><em>Butter-tree</em>, <i>ce</i>, <i>ché</i> or
<i>shea</i>.—Mungo Park describes this tree under the latter name
of <i>shea</i> and <i>shea-toulou</i>. M. Caillié met with it all
over Senegambia as far as Djenné. The <i>nédé</i> and the
<i>ché</i> are the most common trees. Samples of this vegetable
butter were sent to France by M. de Beaufort, and M. Vauquelin was
commissioned by the Academy of Sciences, to analyse it. This tree
would be a most valuable acquisition in our colonies.</p>

<p>We owe to M. Caillié the knowledge of a second vegetable butter
called <i>taman-toulou</i>, preferable, he thinks, to the former.
It is derived from a second tree, which appears to be different.
Its name, or that of the fruit, is <i>taman</i>. The word
<i>toulou</i> means butter or a fat substance in Mandingo. The oil
palm-tree renders nearly the same service to the inhabitants as the
foregoing.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><em>Colat-nut</em>.—The fruit known to Europeans by this name is
very common in the interior of Africa, as well as on the banks of
the Rio-Nuñez. The Mandingo name is <i>ourou</i>. According to M.
Caillié this is the same fruit with that called <i>gour</i> by
Major Denham: but, in reading the work entitled <i>Narrative of
Travels and Discoveries in Northern and Central Africa</i>,
&amp;c., London, 1826, I found this name neither in the
description, nor in the annotations added to this important work by
the learned botanist, Robert Brown.</p>

<p><em>N.B.</em> I pass over in silence several vegetables obtained
by M. Caillié, and mentioned in the journal of the travels, having
nothing to add to what he has reported, and regretting that his
description is insufficient to shew their nature: for example, that
of the <i>caura</i>, which our traveller compares to a plum-tree.
It will be seen by the narrative that orange-trees are indigenous
in the northern part of Senegambia<a id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><em>Carrier Oxen</em>. In the early part of his journal, M.
Caillié mentions, by name only, this species of oxen. It is a
question worthy of the attention of future travellers, both as
regards commerce and expeditions of discovery.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><em>Elephants and Lions</em>. Several persons have testified
surprise that M. Caillié during so long a journey, met with neither
lions, elephants, giraffes, nor any wild beast. I am far from
disputing the testimony of those travellers, who affirm that such
have been seen in inhabited places; but, it is certain, that any
one meeting with such animals on his way cannot have any motive for
passing over the circumstance in silence, and that all travellers
are rather partial to adorning their narratives with encounters of
this kind. It may, therefore, be legitimately inferred that
elephants and lions are more scarce in those regions than the
narratives and descriptions would lead us to believe. M. Caillié,
however, in one or two passages, mentions the traces of elephants’
feet; but no tragic adventures befel him, (or any individual of the
numerous caravans which he accompanied for the space of a year,) by
encounters with these monsters, with wild beasts, or with any other
dangerous animals. The same may be said of crocodiles, which were
supposed to abound in the Dhioliba. Scarcely was he once
incommoded, and that by the neighbourhood of an enormous serpent,
during his whole journey across the great desert.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><em>Tanning</em>. The preparation of leather is frequently
mentioned in the Journal. It is known that the Africans, and the
Moors particularly, are very successful in this operation. Some
persons have thought that desiccation is the means they principally
use; but this seems improbable, because both in Nubia and Egypt the
true process of tanning is in use, and is quite as good as ours,
though shorter. The natives are also skilful in working the
leather; they cut and embroider it with great success.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><em>Beer</em>. M. Caillié sometimes speaks of the use of beer;
but he has neglected to tell us how and with what it is made. Is it
the beverage which in Egypt is called <i>hachich</i>? The Egyptians
prepare this with hemp-seed. It is an inebriating liquor, of which
the common people drink to excess, notwithstanding the rules of
Mahometan abstinence.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><em>The Tankisso</em>. We read at page 204, in the first volume
of this work, that, according to the Mandingoes, this river
<i>issues from the Bafing, and flows into the Dhioliba</i>. It is
difficult, if not impossible, to admit this representation of the
Mandingoes: it must be understood, I think, that the Tankisso
<i>has its source in the same mountain with the Bafing</i>;
otherwise the bason of the Senegambia would communicate with that
of Nigritia or the Soudan.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><em>The route from the Fouta-Toro to Mecca</em>. The author was
told (see vol. I page 259) that the pilgrims of the Fouta travelled
by the Bondou, the Baleya, Kankan, Sambatikila, and Djenné, instead
of by Kaarta and Sego. The former road, however, is much the
longer. I believe that the real motive of these travellers is to
trade in the gold of Bouré, in passing through Kankan; but why go
still farther to the south, by Sambatikila? I do not see the
reason.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><em>The Milo</em>. It is said, vol. I page 280, that the Milo
flows N. E. The first part of the course of this river is nearly N.
E. by the compass; but it afterwards inclines to the north and
west, to fall into the Dhioliba.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><em>Kong</em> or <i>Koung</i>. The country of this name, being
situated between the magnetic S. S. E. and S. ¼ S. E. from the
village of Douasso, (vol. I p. 417) lies to the true south of that
village. Our, traveller was informed by a Kong-man, that the
journey required a month and a half. Part of this journey is
through a mountainous country. The position, therefore, of Kong
cannot be far from the seventh degree north, or its longitude far
from that of Douasso, 7° 45’ west.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><em>Direction of the river near Djenné</em>. The Journal states,
page 444, vol. I, that the island is formed by an arm of the
western branch, which comes from the west-north-west. The island of
Djenné, according to the author, is about twelve or fifteen miles
in circumference; but he admits that he did not go round it, and it
appears to be much larger.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><em>Distance from Djenné to Isaca</em>. The text states it at a
day and a half’s journey; but even in a straight line it proves to
be more than three and a half. The traveller has reckoned it at
four days by water; so that this passage requires correction.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><em>Bousbeyah</em>. The word <i>Bousbehey</i> in the text,
(pages <a href="#Page_58">58</a> and <a href="#Page_101">101</a>,
vol. II) must be thus written, according to the orthography of the
foregoing Arabic list.</p>

<p>There is a contradiction between pages 58 and 101: this place
must necessarily be at more than two days’ distance from
el-Araouan, if it is only two days from Timbuctoo; I have adopted
this latter distance.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><em>Oualet</em>. The town of this name is placed, according to
the Journal, (vol. I page 301) ten days distance from el-A’raouan,
W. N. W.; but it is farther from Sego than stated in the text (the
same page), which is fifteen days south: the interval is nearly
double. This confirms the conjecture I have raised, viz: 1st, that
there are two places of this name; 2nd, that this is different from
the one placed in Mungo Park’s first map north of Sego, <i>but
under the parallel of Lake Dibbie</i>; and the other N. W. of Sego,
a little <i>north of Timbuctoo</i>. This is not the place for
discussing the situation of Oualet and comparing it with the
Gualata of Leo Africanus, which he states<a id=
"FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class=
"fnanchor">[169]</a> to be three hundred miles south of <i>Nun</i>,
five hundred north of <i>Tumbut</i>, and a hundred from the ocean.
It may suffice to say, that a single point cannot possibly fulfil
these different conditions.</p>

<p>I think, however, that there is a very easy solution of the
difficulty. Park and his editors having fallen into the error of
imagining Timbuctoo much more south than it really is, have made a
corresponding change in the position of Oualet: in short, the place
noticed by M. Caillié is situated <i>relatively to Timbuctoo</i>,
very nearly as it is placed in the second map of the English
traveller, and both must be carried much farther north than they
there appear.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>It would be easy to extend these geographical remarks by a
number of scientific deductions, more or less interesting to some
readers; but it is time to bring this volume to a close, and in
conclusion to claim the public indulgence in behalf of a work
hastily drawn up, and whose only substantial recommendation to
attention is the importance of its subject, and the influence which
the discovery itself must sooner or later exercise over future
enterprizes.<a id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class=

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<h4><a id="che_1"></a>DOCUMENTS AND MISCELLANEOUS PAPERS.</h4>

<p>We shall place at the close of our remarks several papers which
the reader will perhaps be well pleased to peruse. In 1824, the
Geographical Society published a <i>programme</i> of a premium to
be decreed to the first French, or foreign, traveller who should
arrive at Timbuctoo by the way of Senegambia. It is known that this
<i>programme</i> was distributed throughout Europe and in Africa,
and that it powerfully influenced the efforts or the projects of
many travellers, and especially the resolution adopted by M.
Caillié. We shall give this <i>programme</i> as published; and
afterwards, the report made to the same Society by the committee
which it appointed four years afterwards to judge of the merit of
the discoveries made by the French traveller. These two papers will
be followed by extracts from the correspondence relative to his
return to Europe.</p>
<br>

<h5>SOCIETY OF GEOGRAPHY 1824.</h5>

<p class="center"><em>Premium for a Journey to Timbuctoo and the
Interior of Africa.</em>
</p>

<p>The fortunate attempt of the English travellers who penetrated
into Central Africa in 1823 has lately attracted the attention of
Europe towards the interior of that continent, which now divides
public curiosity equally with the polar regions, the centre of
Asia, and the new countries of Australia. It was natural that the
Society of Geography should direct its attention to this quarter
also, pointing out as preferable the route already attempted by
Mungo Park, and which touches upon the French establishments in the
Senegal; with it therefore originated the idea of a subscription
for the encouragement of travels to Timbuctoo. It proposes to offer
a premium to any traveller who shall be fortunate enough to
surmount all the perils incident to this enterprise, and who shall
at the same time obtain some certain information and positive
results respecting the geography, the productions, and the commerce
of that country and the regions lying to the east of it. France was
the first country of Europe which formed permanent establishments
on the Senegal, and her honour is interested in assisting those
travellers who seek to penetrate into the interior of Africa, by
the route approaching nearest to her settlements. Such an
enterprise, if successful would not be without profit to our
commercial industry; and, considering it with respect to the
sciences, what an inexhaustible source of discovery would it not
open to natural history, natural philosophy, climatology, physical
geography, and mathematics! What an immense field for a knowledge
of the races of mankind, for the history of the civilization of
nations, for that of their language, of their manners, and of their
religious opinions!</p>

<p>The intention of the donors is not precisely to propose a prize
for competition; the lure of a sum of money could not be offered
for an attempt which might be attended with the loss of life: but
they hold in reserve a just and honourable indemnity for him who
shall happily overcome all the obstacles, to which so many others
have, up to the present time, succumbed.</p>

<p>As the judge and dispenser of this recompense, the Society of
Geography will duly appreciate the merit, the courage, and the
devotedness, of travellers, as well as the real services they may
have rendered to science. It does not expect from a single
individual all the results which would require the concurrence of
several observers and many years peaceable residence in the
country; but it demands precise information, such as may be
expected from a man provided with instruments, and who is no
stranger either to natural or mathematical science. At the present
moment several travellers, both French and English, are proceeding
towards the banks of the Dhioliba, and the Society has reason to
hope that the encouragements held out by it will not prove
unprofitable.</p>

<p>At the meeting of the Central Committee of the 3rd of December
1824, an anonymous donor, a member of the Society, presented a
thousand francs, to be offered as a reward to the first traveller
who shall have penetrated as far as Timbuctoo by the way of the
Senegal, and fulfilled the following conditions pointed out in the
minutes of the said meeting: “To furnish 1st., some positive and
exact observations upon the situation of this city, the course of
the rivers which run in the neighbourhood, and the commerce of
which it is the centre; 2ndly, the most satisfactory and precise
information respecting the country comprised between Timbuctoo and
the lake Tsad, as well as concerning the direction and the height
of the mountains which form the bason of the Soudan.” Immediately
upon being made acquainted with this offer, Count Orloff, Senator
of Russia, consented that the donation of a thousand francs, which
he had made of the sum at the general meeting of the 26th of
November 1824, for the encouragement of geographical discoveries,
should be applied to the same purpose.</p>

<p>On being informed of the object of these donations, his
Excellency the Count Chabrol de Crousol subscribed, on the 15th of
December following, the sum of two thousand francs, in the name of
the Ministry of the Marine, for the same undertaking; by his
letter, dated the 22nd of January last, his Excellency the Baron de
Damas subscribed also, in the name of the Ministry for Foreign
Affairs, the sum of two thousand francs; and by another letter
dated the 19th of March his Excellency the Count de. Corbière
subscribed, in the name of the Ministry of the interior the sum of
one thousand francs. Many other subscriptions have been received or
announced for the same object.</p>

<p>The Society of Geography, charged by the donors to decree the
reward, and wishing to take a direct part in the encouragement of
so important a discovery, has resolved moreover to offer a gold
medal of the value of <i>two thousand francs</i> to the traveller
who, independently of the conditions already declared, shall have
satisfied, as far as possible those which are explained below.</p>

<p>The Society demands a manuscript narrative, with a geographical
map, founded upon celestial observations. The author shall
endeavour to study the country with reference to the principal
points of its physical geography. He shall observe the nature of
the soil, the depth of the wells, their temperature and that of
their sources, the width and the rapidity of the rivers, the colour
and the clearness of their waters, and the productions of the
countries which they irrigate. He shall make remarks upon the
climate, and determine in various places, if possible, the
declination and inclination of the magnetic needle. He shall strive
to observe the different breeds of animals, and to make some
collections in natural history, such as fossils, shells, and
plants.</p>

<p>When he shall have arrived at Timbuctoo, if he cannot go
further, he shall acquaint himself with the routes leading to
Kachnah, Haoussa, Bournou, and lake Tsaad, to Walet, Tischit, and
even the coast of Guinea. He shall collect the most accurate
itineraries he can procure, and consult the best informed
inhabitants upon that part of the course of the Dhioliba which he
cannot see for himself.</p>

<p>In observing the people, he shall take care to examine their
manners, ceremonies, customs, weapons, laws, religion, food,
diseases, the colour of their skin, the form of their face, the
nature of their hair, and also the different articles of their
commerce. It is desirable that he should form vocabularies of their
idioms, compared with the French language; finally, that he should
make drawings of the details of their habitations, and take plans
of the towns wherever it is possible to do so.</p>

<h5>REPORT OF THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE APPOINTED TO INVESTIGATE M.
CAILLIÉ’S TRAVELS TO TIMBUCTOO AND IN THE INTERIOR OF AFRICA.</h5>

<p class="pad1 sc">Gentlemen,</p>

<p>You have appointed a committee, consisting of Messrs. Eyriés,
Cadet de Metz, Amédée Jaubert, Larenaudière, Baron Roger, and
myself, to ascertain the facts resulting from the travels of M.
Auguste Caillié in the interior of Africa. This committee has
assembled, and I am charged by it to make you the following report.
Our first care was to satisfy ourselves on the points of the
traveller’s departure, the routes which he had followed, and the
countries and places which he had visited. Interrogated on these
various questions, and on all the circumstances of his travels, he
replied in the clearest and most satisfactory manner. The committee
is struck with the tone of simplicity and sincerity which reigns
throughout his narrative, and which will not admit a doubt of the
reality and authenticity of his different excursions; namely the
crossing of the Dhioliba, his route to the east of the districts of
Soulimana and Kissi, his navigation on the great river, his
residence at Timbuctoo, and his journey across the great desert to
the empire of Morocco. Baron Roger had positive information of his
departure from St. Louis, and of his arrival the following year at
Kakondy, whence he sent intelligence to the Senegal of his
departure for the interior. Thus the point of his departure is
proved: it is the same with the point of his arrival, since he was
received, almost immediately on issuing from the desert, by our
colleague M. Delaporte, vice-consul-general at Tangier. With regard
to Timbuctoo, besides the very circumstantial details related by
our traveller, and the sketches which he took during his stay, we
have a guarantee of another kind in his account of the catastrophe
of the unfortunate Major Laing, who had reached this city in 1826.
Notwithstanding the variety of rumours relative to this melancholy
event, M. Caillié’s story agrees with that of a Moor who arrived at
Saint-Louis in March last, coming from Timbuctoo, and who saw
amongst the Touariks the books which had belonged to the Major.
Moreover, our countryman resided in a neighbouring house to that
which had been occupied by the English traveller, and there
obtained exact information, the source of which seems to be
incontestable.</p>

<p>The committee is enabled to add further reasons for confidence
to the preceding. During the earlier part of his travels, that is,
while advancing eastward across the mountains of Fouta-Dhialon, he
passed between the towns of Timbo and Labey, and consequently must
have intersected the route followed in 1818 by our colleague M.
Mollien. Now, such is his description of the mountains, the
villages, the aspect of the country, and all the localities, that
M. Mollien perfectly recognised them in the picture drawn of them
by M. Caillié. These two travellers then mutually confirm each
other; and the result, by the way, is not unimportant to
geography.</p>

<p>Our countryman has with so much attention and perseverance
recorded his routes, their direction, and the hours of march, that
one of our associates has found it easy to form, from his journal,
a continued and complete itinerary from Kakondy to the port of
Rabat, in the states of Morocco, in which the nature and various
accidents of the soil are indicated, such as the mountains, plains,
ravines, and forests, the villages and all inhabited places, the
rivulets, lakes, and morasses, the torrents, cataracts, fords,
wells, and every thing relating both to the running and stagnant
waters. Such minute details complete our confidence in the
genuineness of this narrative.</p>

<p>We will add that, having interrogated him as to the manner in
which he made himself understood by the inhabitants, he told us it
was principally through the medium of the Moorish-Arabic, spoken in
Senegal, and which he had enjoyed the opportunity of learning in
that country ever since 1816. And he replied in fact in this
dialect to the questions proposed to him by the committee; he
moreover pronounced several words in Mandingo, in a manner
conformable to the existing vocabularies.</p>

<p>We were sensible, gentlemen, that it was our duty to lay before
you all these consideration, and to insist upon them. It now
remains for us to make known some of the results obtained, in order
that the Society may appreciate the acquisitions that have accrued
to science. We are not at liberty here to enter into minute detail;
that would be anticipating the publication. A general retrospect is
all that the committee consider themselves called upon to offer at
present to the public curiosity.</p>

<p>The travels of M. Caillié are connected, in a manner the most
useful for perfecting and confirming our geographical knowledge,
with those of Watt and Winterbottom to Timbo, in 1794; of Major
Laing in the countries of Kouranko and Soulimana, in 1822; of M.
Mollien in Fouta-Dhialon, in 1818; of Mungo Park to the Dhioliba,
in 1795 and 1805, of Dochard to Yamina and Bamakou, in 1819; and
lastly with the itineraries of the caravans, travelling from
Timbuctoo to Tafilet.</p>

<p>No doubts can now remain of the very elevated sources of the
Bafing, the principal tributary of the Senegal. Setting out on the
19th of April 1827 from Kakondy, the tomb of Majors Peddie and
Campbell, M. Caillié crossed this river at Bafila; he crossed also
the main stream of the Dhioliba at a point which very naturally
connects itself with the situation assigned by Major Laing to its
source. Thence he proceeded to Kankan, a large town in the district
so named, enriched by the gold mines of Bourré, and after some
residence there, he continued his journey two hundred miles farther
east, beyond Soulimana, to the village of Timé, where he arrived on
the 3rd of August. He had till then accompanied a caravan of
Mandingo merchants, travelling on foot. In this village, he was
detained by sickness for five whole months, and attacked by a
scorbutic affection, which for a long time endangered his life, and
which was induced by the intemperance of the climate and by the
violent fatigue he had undergone in traversing the steep mountains
of Fouta-Dhialon. This great chain appears to be composed of
several stages, and full of torrents and precipices. In this
interesting portion of his route, he carefully collected
intelligence of the situation of Bamakou, and of its intercourse
with the Senegambia, which, it is hoped, will not prove
unprofitable.</p>

<p>At Timé commenced another journey northwards; this is the second
part of the travels. M. Caillié wished to return to the Dhioliba;
he set out on the 9th of January, 1829, and after having seen or
passed through more than a hundred villages, and acquainted himself
pretty accurately with the situation of Sego, he again saw the
river on the 10th of March, at Galia, flowing from the west, and
crossed an arm of it to repair to Djenné. All this part is entirely
new, as well as the route from the environs of Timbo to Timé.</p>

<p>The third part of the travels is on the great river; M. Caillié
embarked on it on the 23rd of March, after a residence of thirteen
days at Jenné. He ascended it in a large boat, forming part of a
flotilla of merchant vessels.</p>

<p>It was the season of low water: in some places the river is a
mile in width, and in others much narrower; its depth and rapidity
are variable. He noted and described, as he went along, the
branches and islands, and especially lake Debo (the same which is
known and designed upon the maps under the name of Dibbie, but
misplaced), and he furnishes particulars, as certain as they are
new, concerning the whole course of the stream.</p>

<p>At length he arrived at Cabra, the port of Timbuctoo, on the
19th of April, and the next day entered the town. After he had
taken sketches of the dwellings and other edifices of this city,
remarked every thing worthy of observation, and acquainted himself
with the course of the neighbouring waters, he joined a caravan
setting out for Morocco. On the 4th of May he commenced his
journey, with eight hundred camels, loaded with all sorts of
merchandise from the interior, and in six days arrived at
el-Araouan: there the caravan was increased by six hundred camels,
and in eight days more it reached the wells of Télig. All the
wells, whether of sweet or brackish water, and all the stations,
are carefully noted by M. Caillié, in this journey across the great
desert. The season of the burning east winds aggravated the toils
and privations of this painful journey. On the 19th of May he left
el-Araouan, and it was not till the 29th of June that he reached
el-Harib, where the caravan split into several divisions, and on
the 23rd of July he entered Tafilet. He rested at length, on the
12th of August, in the very spot where, in the fourteenth
century,<a id="Page_457"></a> Ben-Batouta cast away the pilgrim’s
staff, in the city of Fez; he afterwards continued his route with a
guide, reached the sea, and on the 17th of the same month,
September, arrived at Tangier, where the Consul of France received
him, provided for his safety, and succeeded in preserving him from
the dangers which he would have incurred, had he been recognized
through his disguise.</p>

<p>M. Caillié had provided himself, before his departure, with two
compasses, which he used during his travels, and by their aid he
was enabled to mark the directions of his route. However imperfect
such a method may be, in comparison with geometrical operations and
astronomical observations, we must yet congratulate ourselves on
having obtained a tracing of the route, and the information of an
eye-witness respecting countries, of which we previously possessed
only Arab itineraries, reckoned by days’ journeys, and for the most
part contradictory, vague, and confused. A further proof that he
has correctly noted the length of his journeys is, that they
perfectly correspond with those distances of places in the empire
of Morocco which are the most accurately known.</p>

<p>The success of M. Caillié’s enterprize is the more worthy of
interest for having been accomplished solely by his own resources,
without either participation or assistance from any one. He
sacrificed every thing he possessed to supply his wants on these
travels. He has achieved every thing possible, and more than could
have been hoped for with such resources, and he has the
satisfaction of having completely succeeded.</p>

<p>If such services are calculated to ensure to M. Caillié the
favour of the public and of the government, how powerfully ought
they to excite the interest and gratitude of the Geographical
Society! It was by the Society’s <i>programme</i>, published in
1824, that he was finally determined to penetrate into the interior
of an unknown continent. One of our members, being then resident in
Senegal, and finding that he had been for several years animated by
a passion for travels, communicated to him a copy of this
<i>programme</i>; during the three succeeding years M. Caillié
incessantly exerted every possible effort, till he had discovered
the means of accomplishing his adventurous design. This is attested
by a witness most worthy of credit, our colleague Baron Roger, at
that time governor of Senegal. During this period M. Caillié
quitted Saint Louis, visited several neighbouring districts, and
then fixed on the Rio-Nuñez as the point for his departure; at
Kakondy he was fortunate enough to meet with a caravan setting out
for the interior, and he skilfully seized the favourable
opportunity.</p>

<p>The <i>programme</i> published by the Society in 1824 consists
of two parts. The first principally requires accurate particulars
respecting Timbuctoo, and the rivers near it, with notices of the
eastern countries. M. Caillié has performed most of these
conditions. The second part, for which the Society offered a
special prize, exacted, is true, astronomical observations; but it
is questionable, whether any one penetrating for the first time
into this country, even if provided with the necessary instruments,
could possibly fulfil conditions so difficult and dangerous. Who is
there but is acquainted with the savage jealousy which the Moors
and all those in possession of the commerce of this part of Africa,
have from the earliest ages conceived against Europeans; the
resistance experienced by Belzoni, when he attempted to pursue this
direction; the tragic end of Antonio Piloti, and the sad
termination of Major Laing’s enterprise?</p>

<p>A. Caillié penetrated as far as Timbuctoo; he went thither by
way of Senegambia, as required by the Society. If he has not
executed all that it was desirable to have accomplished, he has, on
the other hand, made many new and valuable observations, which were
not required, upon Fouta-Dhialon, the eastern districts, and the
upper part of the course of the Dhioliba; he navigated the river
for a month; gleaned intelligence respecting the mines of Bourré,
and made other researches that were not required; all which
constitutes a sort of equivalent. The discovery of these countries,
and the description given of the regions of Baleya, Kankan, and
Ouassoulo, are so great an acquisition to geography, that, had he
even failed to reach Timbuctoo, he would have deserved a signal
recompense. He has the additional merit of having collected a
vocabulary of the Mandingo language, and another of the Kissour,
spoken at Timbuctoo concurrently with the Moorish, as well as of
having taken notes of what relates to the customs, ceremonies,
productions, and commerce, of the several countries. On the other
hand, our <i>programme</i> contains conditions which have been
partly fulfilled, since its publication, by the celebrated English
travellers, Oudney, Clapperton, and Denham; namely, those which
relate to the districts east and E. S. E. of Timbuctoo: we had,
therefore, no longer the same motives for requiring their
accomplishment.</p>

<p>In awarding, therefore, to M. Caillié the recompense promised to
any one who should reach the city of Timbuctoo, and furnish a
description of it, the Society will satisfy the general
expectation, and be assured of possessing accurate information
concerning countries nearly or wholly unknown; it will grant its
honourable suffrage to a man who speaks of them, not upon hearsay,
but upon the evidence of his own eyes; who, in his simple and
unaffected narrative, relates, without any exaggeration, what he
has observed, and does not endeavour to excite attention by
extraordinary adventures. This is precisely the kind of interest
which the Geographical Society attaches to discoveries—that of
truth.</p>

<p>It is no small achievement for a man to have broken through the
species of enchantment, with which every European appears to have
been struck on reaching the mysterious point of the Dhioliba. It is
now certain that four or five months are sufficient for a traveller
to arrive in Europe from Timbuctoo. Now that the possibility of the
journey and return is proved by the event, and not left to
conjecture, all men devoted to African researches, who may have
been diverted from their design by such repeated catastrophes
following one another, will take fresh courage and prosecute the
enterprize. This constitutes an additional important service,
rendered to Science by A. R. Caillié, and for which she will hold
herself his debtor, though his success may not entirely console her
for the lamented loss of Major Laing.</p>

<p>On a subject so fertile in geographical and scientific
developments, it would be easy to expatiate; but the committee feel
the propriety of confining themselves within the limits of their
mission; their end is attained if they have produced conviction.
They, therefore, feel it necessary equally to pass over in silence
the accounts of J. Leon, Ben-Batouta, and el-Adrisi; and the
intercourse of the Portuguese with Timbuctoo in the fifteenth
century; the travels of Paul Imbert in the seventeenth; the still
contested journey of Robert Adams in 1810, and so many other
travels which, within the last forty years, have succeeded each
other. To act otherwise would be to forget that we address an
auditory, who are masters of the principles of every problem in
African geography, which, gentlemen is sufficiently attested by the
subjects of your three prizes in favour of men determined upon
braving every danger to explore this vast continent for the common
benefit of science and humanity.</p>

<p>It will be easy, from these premises, to conjecture the
propositions which the committee has the honour of laying before
you; first, that you should grant to M. Auguste Caillié the prize
which you have offered to the first traveller who should reach
Timbuctoo by way of Senegambia; secondly, that this report should
be communicated to their Excellencies the Ministers of the
Interior, of the Marine, and of Foreign Affairs.</p>

<p>We cannot conclude this report without paying a just tribute of
gratitude to M. Delaporte, Vice-Consul-General at Tangier, for the
generous and zealous care which he lavished on our countryman; the
Society owes him a particular testimonial of gratitude for having
preserved the traveller and his papers.</p>

<p class="pad1 sc">Sir,</p>

<p>I have the honour to be a member of the Geographical Society;
you will therefore believe with what pleasure I must have perused
the letter which you addressed to me, dated the 21st of this month,
through the medium of the agent of France at Rabat, and how
satisfactory to me must be the arrival in safety of such a
traveller as yourself, Sir, who may have solved the great problem
of the possibility of traversing Africa. It gives me pleasure to
believe that you have visited the towns you mention in your
interesting letter, and particularly the city of Timbuctoo, the
rock upon which, for two or three generations past, so many
intrepid travellers have been lost; but the proofs which you
furnish are not sufficient to confirm my faith: you know how far
impostors are capable of deceiving us. Have the goodness, then,
to<a id="Page_464"></a> supply me with more ample and precise
information, that I may make use of it with our government, the
patron of great enterprises, and with the Geographical Society, to
the gratitude and admiration of which you will have acquired such
unexceptionable titles.</p>

<p>I shall write to the agent of France at the place where you have
so miraculously arrived, desiring him to give you all the
assistance which your situation demands, to receive such
declarations as you may wish to make, respecting the difficult and
interesting journey you have just completed, and to furnish you
with the means of conveyance to Gibraltar, or to me, if you should
prefer coming hither.</p>

<p>If, however, you should fear being compromised by a declaration,
a report, or other legal statement, address to me a letter for the
president of the Geographical Society, which I will convey to him
through his Excellency the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</p>

<p>If you should decide to come to Tangier, undertake the journey
in such a manner as not to commit yourself, and above all, be
circumspect in regard to the religion you have embraced, for the
Moors are no triflers on this subject; they are inexorable. Have
the goodness, also, to form into a single packet all the daily
notes you may have taken during the sixteen months of your arduous
journey, and the information you may have collected; request the
French agent at Rabat to seal it with his seal, and to send it to
me by a courier, according to the directions which the agent will
receive from me, in order that these valuable and interesting
documents, which shall be preserved for you, may not be lost.</p>

<p>I should think myself happy, Sir, to be the first member of the
Geographical Society who should enjoy the advantage of embracing an
associate who has successfully passed through all the variety of
fortune, hazards, and perils of a journey, in which so many have
failed; and to give assistance to a countryman under the numerous
sufferings which so much exertion and fatigue must have
produced.</p>

<p>I shall wait further intelligence from you before I communicate
your arrival to those interested in it.</p>

<p>I request you to believe me, with admiration, Sir, your very
humble and obedient servant.</p>

<p class="right">Tangier, 15th September, 1828,</p>

<p>M. Caillié, (Réné-Auguste) has undertaken the painful and
dangerous journey from the Senegal and Sierra-Leone to Tangier,
passing through the city of Timbuctoo, and has had the good fortune
to surmount all the difficulties, which, as you will judge, are
inseparable from such an enterprise.</p>

<p>Chance has thrown him upon an agent of his majesty’s government,
and a member of the Geographical Society, upon me: I take the best
possible care of him; and feel pride in receiving a suffering
fellow-citizen, the first European who has acquired for our country
a knowledge of the city of Timbuctoo, the search after which has
cost so many lives, and so much treasure.</p>

<p>M. Caillié presented himself to me under the costume of a
mendicant Dervish, a character which I assure you he did not belie:
during his journey he feigned himself a follower of Mahomet. If the
Moors had suspected him of being with me, or at the consulate, he
would have been a lost man; I entreat then, from your humanity,
your love and admiration of great enterprises, assistance in saving
this intrepid traveller, whose name will soon become celebrated, by
sending to me, if at present disposable, one of the vessels under
your command, or if you think it preferable, by coming hither
yourself. You would land here. M. Caillié would adopt the
accoutrements of a sailor, or personate an officer; he would mix
with the attendants on the equipage, or with the staff; he would
reach your ship, and be saved. It would be grateful to you and to
myself to have co-operated in the protection of this remarkable
traveller.</p>

<p>The English would not hesitate an instant to receive on board
one of their sovereign’s ships of the line a countryman of such
merit. It was lately published at Gibraltar, that Major Laing had
arrived there in the costume of an Arab; a king’s cutter was
immediately placed at his disposal, to transport him to London;
instead of Major Laing, it proved to be M. Linc; the similarity of
name caused the mistake, but the cutter had been dispatched to its
destination.</p>

<p>Will you oblige me by an answer, and by informing me whether it
will be in your power to render to France, if I may so express
myself, and to the Geographical Society of France, the service
which I request of you in their name, on behalf of M. Caillié; that
if necessary I may seek other means of restoring him to his
country.</p>

<p>M. Caillié whose name I have read in one of the numbers of the
Bulletins of the Geographical Society, has traversed Africa, from
Rio-Nuñez to Tangier, passing, on his route, through Timbuctoo. He
will embark to-day on board a king’s schooner for Toulon, where he
will arrive without resources. I hope the Geographical Society will
take charge of this traveller, who, I believe will do it honour. He
has crossed Africa as a mendicant; as such he appeared at my door:
but I received him, I paid him every possible attention, and think
myself happy in being the first Frenchman who has embraced him.</p>

<p>He will present himself to you, and will communicate to you the
materials of which he is the bearer: he proposes to intrust you
with the task of editing them<a id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href=

consoles himself under this misfortune, in the happiness of being
the only European who has conquered the great difficulty, and of
having enriched the reign of his Majesty Charles X with an
enterprise which has baffled so many travellers and scientific
men.</p>

<p>Have the goodness to present him to the President of the
Society, to recommend him to all its members, and to pay him the
attention which he deserves.</p>

<p>I have introduced to you the French traveller Caillié, who has
crossed the burning deserts of Africa, and there contracted the
scurvy, which has eaten into the bones of his palate. If God, who
has been his protector as far as Tangier, should preserve his
health, he will reach you two or three months’ hence. Instead, of
confused itineraries, put together from hearsay, and taken by
stealth, such as those which for several years past I have
furnished, he will present himself to you with authentic labours,
with documents, and materials taken on the spot, of which he will
request you to superintend the compilation. Do not refuse your
assistance.</p>

<p>This traveller has deserved the prize for the journey to
Timbuctoo by the route of Senegal, because he set out from St.
Louis to reach Tangier; he is also entitled to that for the most
important discovery in geography, as he will prove by his work:
they cannot be refused to him.</p>

<p class="pad1 sc">Sir,</p>

<p>My zeal for geographical discoveries induced me to undertake, in
1827, a journey into the interior of Africa, to visit the city of
Timbuctoo, the object of anxious research to Europe, and which has
proved fatal to so many illustrious travellers. Being unable to
obtain a mission from the French Government of the Senegal, I
determined to undertake the journey with my private resources: for
this purpose then I realized all my effects and made preparations
for my expedition.</p>

<p>On the 19th of April 1827, I quitted Kakondy upon the Rio-Nuñez,
in company with Mandingo merchants going to the Niger: the Arab
costume and the religion of the Prophet, which I adopted, smoothed
all difficulties; I traversed without obstacle the elevated
mountains of the Fouta-Dhialon, the Kankan and the Ouassoulo. I
resided five months at Timé on account of severe illness. This
village is inhabited by Mahometan Mandingoes; and is situated in
the southern part of the Bambara. Early in January 1828, I
continued my route; I visited the island and town of Jenné, and
embarked on the Niger for Timbuctoo, where I arrived after a
difficult navigation of a month: I resided in that town fourteen
days, acquired all the information in my power respecting it;
studied the manners and customs of the inhabitants, and the
commerce and resources of the country; and thence travelled
northwards to accomplish my return by the great desert. I passed
through el-Araouan; after two months of the most painful
privations, I arrived in the Tafilet, and continued my route by Fez
and Rabat to Tangier, where M. Delaporte, the French Vice-Consul in
that town, lavished upon me all the assistance of which I stood so
much in need. I soon after embarked on board the king’s schooner
<i>La Légère</i>, which conveyed me to Toulon, where I now am,
convalescent, and without means of support, having exhausted my all
in a journey of sixteen months.</p>

<p class="pad1 sc">Sir,</p>

<p>I had the good fortune, in 1824, to take a journey among the
people who inhabit the smiling banks of the Senegal: from that
period I projected an attempt to explore central Africa, to visit
the towns of Jenné and Timbuctoo, in hopes if possible to surpass
the English who had so far outstripped us in this career. Having
been unable to obtain a mission from the Government of the Senegal,
I determined to part with all my resources, convinced that on my
return, the services I might have rendered would be recognized by
Government; I realized then the small means which I possessed, the
fruits of economy, and made preparations for my departure. On the
19th of April, 1827, I quitted Kakondy upon the Rio-Nuñez, in
company with a caravan of Mandingo merchants going to the Niger.
Thanks to the Arab costume and to the religion of the country which
I outwardly embraced, the numerous difficulties attendant on this
laborious journey were overcome; and to this disguise I owe the
success of my expedition. I crossed without obstacle the high
mountains of the Senegambia, the countries of Baleya, Kankan, and
Ouassoulo. I was compelled to reside five months at Timé, a village
of Mahometan Mandingoes, situated in the southern part of Bambara,
being detained by a severe illness which had nearly proved fatal.
On the 9th of January, 1828, I was able to proceed on my journey. I
visited the island and town of Jenné; and afterwards embarked upon
the Niger, on board a vessel of sixty tons burden going to
Timbuctoo, where I arrived after a month’s tedious navigation. This
town is situated five miles to the north of Cabra, in a plain of
quicksand, where nothing grows but stunted shrubs: I resided there
fourteen days. I inspected the town and took a sketch of it; I
studied the manners and customs of the inhabitants, and the
commerce and resources of the country; then taking a northern
direction to cross the great desert, I arrived at el-Araouan. This
town is six days’ journey north of Timbuctoo: it is the emporium of
salt which is exported thence to Sansanding and Yamina, and is
situated in a country still more sterile than even that about
Timbuctoo. Not a shrub is to be seen; and camel dung is used for
fuel. The burning east wind which constantly prevails renders this
a very disagreeable abode. I continued my route northwards, and
reached the Wells of Telig, after eight days’ journey from
el-Araouan. Here we quenched our thirst and proceeded north north
west into the heart of the desert: here the soil is most barren,
composed of moving sand and rocks of grey quartz veined with white;
there is also a little granite. After two months’ journey in this
horrible country, I reached the Tafilet, a small district forming
part of the empire of Marocco, and passed through Fez, Mequinaz,
Rabat, and Tangier, where I was received by M. Delaporte,
Vice-Consul of France, who lavished upon me all the assistance of
which I stood so much in need. I soon after embarked in the king’s
schooner La Légère, which conveyed me to Toulon, where I have been
twenty-two days in quarantine. I am convalescent and without means
of support, having exhausted all in an arduous journey of sixteen
months.</p>

<p>After having heard the preceding communications at the meeting
of the 17th of October, the central committee of the Geographical
Society decided unanimously, that a first pecuniary indemnity
should be immediately sent to M. Auguste Caillié, and that extracts
from these letters should be printed in a supplement to the 66th
Bulletin.</p>

<h5><em>Letter of</em> <span class="sc">M. Delaporte</span> <em>to
the President of the Geographical Society.</em></h5>

<p class="right">Tangier, 3rd October 1828.</p>

<p class="pad1 sc">Mr. President,</p>

<p>To communicate to you that a European has just conquered in
Africa, for the Geographical Society, a vast extent of territory,
is to impart good news both to you and the Society; but the
announcement that this European is a Frenchman will render it still
more agreeable.</p>

<p>One of our countrymen, M. Auguste Caillié, has acquired for the
Society all the territories situated between Rio-Nuñez, (Sierra
Leone) and Tangier, that is to say between the Ocean and the
Mediterranean. He has visited the towns of Kankan, Jenné,
Timbuctoo, and Araouan. He sojourned fourteen days at Timbuctoo.
His house was within a few doors of that which had been inhabited
by the unfortunate Major Laing. He has employed sixteen months upon
this labour and in collecting the materials with which he has
enriched his wallet. Nothing disheartened him, neither refusal, nor
disgust, nor fatigue, nor danger; his vocation, as he has
frequently repeated to me, demanded that he should cross Africa; he
followed it and has solved the problem that a European may traverse
this continent, a problem, the impossibility of which appeared all
but demonstrated. He travelled without ostentation; and I saw a
mendicant Dervish, with his leathern wallet at his back, seated at
the threshold of my door, and extending to me, not the hand of
indigence, not the hand of that misery of which he bore the livery,
but of a compatriot, addressing himself to a servant of the King of
France, and requiring his protection. He obtained it, Sir; it was
afforded to him by me, in the character of temporary administrator
of the General Consulate of France, to the utmost of my power; and
thanks to the co-operation of the Chevalier de Luneau, commander of
the French naval station off Cadiz, who had the complaisance to
send me a king’s ship, I have saved the traveller and his papers.
Lieutenant Jollivet received M. Caillié on board the king’s
schooner La Légère, which he commands; and on the 28th of last
September he set sail for Toulon where he will perform his
quarantine.</p>

<p>Two departments, those of Foreign Affairs and of the Marine,
have contributed to restore a Frenchman to his native country, and
to acquire for the Society over which you preside a modest
traveller, whose enterprise will reflect lustre upon it.</p>

<p>M. Caillié, whose health has been affected by the fatigue and
labour he has undergone, embarked with a fever. It is to be hoped
that it will have no ill consequences, and that he will land at
Toulon in health and safety.</p>

<p>If M. Caillié does not possess the brilliant qualifications or
the education of our modern travellers, he has the ingenuousness
and frankness of the honest traveller of the olden time who has
given us so much interesting information concerning India; if he is
not the Amédée Jaubert of Asia, he will be the Marco-Polo of
Africa; and he will have had the merit of achieving, at his own
expense and without assistance, what others have been unable to
effect with ample treasures.</p>

<p>After his quarantine, he will repair to Paris, where he proposes
to request the assistance of the Chevalier Jomard, vice-president
of the Central Committee, of the Society, in editing the rich
materials in which alone his fortune consists. To bespeak, Sir,
your interest in favor of this traveller, is to recommend him to
all the members of the Geographical Society, to which I have the
honour to belong.</p>

more deeply concerned than myself in the success of your journey,
and I have not lost a moment in communicating to the Geographical
Society the contents of your letters and those of M. Delaporte.</p>

<p>After attending to the reading of them with marks of the most
lively satisfaction, the Society decided that, while the effect of
the representations I am about to make to the government is in
suspense, the sum of five hundred francs should be transmitted to
you to relieve your immediate wants, and to assist you in your
journey to Paris.</p>

<p>We think, Sir, that it will conduce to your interest to make the

in committing to paper all your recollections while still fresh in
your memory; and particularly that you should note, with exactness,
the hours or the days of march, the bearings you followed, and
whatever from its nature is liable to be forgotten, as the names of
places and proper names in general.</p>

feeble interest; and, above all, take the repose which is so
necessary to the re-establishment of your health after such long
continued fatigue.</p>

<h5><em>Extract of a Letter to the President of the Academy of
Sciences.</em>
</h5>

<p class="right">Paris, 18th October, 1828.</p>

<p class="pad1 sc">Mr. President,</p>

<p>I have the honour to communicate to the Academy of Sciences the
contents of the letters which I yesterday received from M.
Delaporte, Vice-Consul of France, administering the general
Consulate at Tangier. A Frenchman has accomplished the journey to
Timbuctoo. He has been fortunate enough to traverse almost the
whole of Africa, north of the Equator, from the Rio-Nuñez, in about
10° 15’ north latitude, to the Straits of Gibraltar, and is arrived
in health and safety at the Consulate at Tangier, after having
crossed the Atlas between Tafilet and Fez, and travelled during
sixteen consecutive months.</p>

<p>As he is the first European who has succeeded in the journey to
Timbuctoo, and returned from that place, I doubt not, whatever the
results may prove for which the sciences may be indebted to him,
that the Academy will learn the news with a lively interest.</p>

<p>On the 19th of April, 1827, M. Caillié set out from Kakondy on
the Rio-Nuñez, whence he travelled easterly nearly three hundred
leagues, to Timé, beyond the great river Dhioliba. He embarked upon
it near Jenné, and after a month’s navigation reached Timbuctoo, in
April last. After a residence there of several weeks he pursued his
route to the north and N. N. W. Seventy-five days were occupied by
his journey from this capital to the Tafilet, across the Sahara, or
Great Desert, amidst the severest fatigues and most painful
privations.</p>

<p>The first part of his journey coincides with that of some
English travellers<a id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172"
class="fnanchor">[172]</a>. He subsequently crossed the different
stages of the chain of mountains of the Fouta-Dhialon, in the midst
of which he crossed the route taken by Mollien, and perhaps the
Senegal near its source.</p>

<p>As he travelled little more than twelve geographical miles a
day, he had time for attentive observation. He traversed the
countries of Belia, Kankan, and Ouassoulo, which we barely know by
name; and finally, before arriving at Jenné, had an opportunity of
seeing Bamakou, Yamina, Sego, and Sansanding<a id=
"FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class=
"fnanchor">[173]</a>.</p>

<p>Such is a sketch of the journey which M. Caillié has just
completed, extending to about fifteen hundred leagues, a thousand
of them through regions almost unknown. We may at once infer from
it, that Timbuctoo lies much nearer to the ocean than it is marked
upon all the maps. His marches confirm the conjecture which I have
already brought forward that this great town is not far from the
seventeenth degree of north latitude.</p>

<h5><em>Letter of the Presidents and Secretary of the Geographical

</h5>

<p class="right">Paris, 20th October, 1828.</p>

<p class="pad1 sc">Monseigneur,</p>

<p>By the letter which Your Excellency did us the honour to address
to us, dated the 2nd of April last, you manifest a desire to
receive information of any intelligence which may reach us upon the
subject of the enterprises formed by the Society, and especially
upon the discoveries which relate to the interior of Africa.</p>

<p>We consider it our duty to communicate, without delay, to Your
Excellency, the news which we have received within the last two
days. A Frenchman has been fortunate enough to penetrate into
central Africa. He even appears to have resided for some time in
the city of Timbuctoo. Having quitted in 1827 the banks of the
Rio-Nuñez, he travelled eastwards to beyond the Dhioliba, crossing
the high mountains of the upper Senegambia. He afterwards followed
the course of that great river, and embarked upon it opposite to
Jenné. After a month’s navigation he landed at Cabra, the port of
Timbuctoo. Having made all the observations in his power, he
entered the great desert of Sahara, across which two months and
fourteen days toilsome travel brought him to the Tafilet, whence he
proceeded to Tangier. There, M. Delaporte, his Majesty’s
Vice-Consul, administering the general Consulate, received him,
relieved his immediate necessities, and procured him a passage to
France on board one of the vessels of the state.</p>

<p>This interesting traveller is named Caillié. He had been at the
Senegal since 1824: it was in the month of April 1827, that he
repaired to Kakondy upon the Rio-Nuñez; where he joined a caravan
of Mandingo merchants. This situation is the more deserving of
notice, as before his embarkation he had undergone a serious
illness which detained him five months to the south of Jenné. The
total length of his route is from twelve to fourteen hundred
leagues, a thousand of them through regions nearly unknown.</p>

<p>Such is the substance of the letters we have just received from
the traveller. The reception he experienced from the Vice-Consul, a
gentleman well versed in the languages and relations of Northern
Africa, has determined that of the Geographical Society, which has
hastened to present him with marks of encouragement.</p>

<p>We hope, Monseigneur, that this news will interest Your
Excellency, that you will honour this traveller with marks of your
approbation, and that you will recommend him to the Minister of the
Marine, that he may obtain from him the assistance of which he
stands in need to facilitate his journey to Paris. All his
resources have been exhausted in a laborious journey of sixteen
months. He is the first European, who, after having penetrated into
this part of central Africa, has returned in health and safety. The
Geographical Society takes credit to itself for having directed the
attention of travellers of all countries to the interior of this
continent; but it rejoices to find that it is a Frenchman, who has
first attained the glory of success.</p>

<p class="pad1 sc">Monseigneur,</p>

<p>A French traveller, M. A. Caillié has just arrived at Toulon on
board the king’s schooner <i>La Légère</i>, after having brought to
a happy termination a difficult and painful journey in the interior
of Africa, from Rio-Nuñez to Tangier. It appears that he has
resided for some time in the town of Timbuctoo. This arduous
journey has exhausted all his resources, and his health is impaired
by long continued fatigue. His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Tangier
recommends him to the Geographical Society, that it may procure for
him from the government the means to proceed to Paris. As this is
the first European traveller who has accomplished such an
enterprise, we think ourselves entitled, Monseigneur, with
confidence to solicit your interest in his behalf, and to request
for him the support of your benevolence. The Society entreats you
to have the goodness to procure for him the means of conveyance to
Paris.</p>

<h5>Mr. <span class="sc">John Barrow</span>, <em>to</em>
<span class="sc">M. Jomard</span>.</h5>

<p class="pad1 sc">Sir,</p>

<p>I have the honour to address myself to you on a subject in which
I am persuaded you take as much interest as myself—the progress of
the discoveries in Africa.</p>

<p>I see by the supplement to the 66th Bulletin published by the
Geographical Society of Paris, that a Frenchman, of the name of
Caillié, has succeeded in reaching the city of Timbuctoo; and that
M. Delaporte, Vice-Consul at Tangier, observes in his letter to
you, announcing the arrival of M. Caillié, that that traveller
consoles himself for the fatigues which he has endured by the
reflection that he is the only European who has hitherto succeeded
in happily accomplishing an enterprise in which so many brave
travellers have fallen.</p>

<p>Far be it from me to conceive the idea of detracting from the
merit of this bold and adventurous traveller, or to blame the just
pride which he feels at having brought his enterprise to a happy
termination; but the justice which is due to the memory of another
traveller, who has perished by the barbarous hand of an assassin,
calls upon me to shew you, Sir, that M. Caillié is neither the
only, nor the first European who has visited Timbuctoo.</p>

<p>The late Major Laing was the first who reached Timbuctoo, as I
shall prove by the most indisputable authority—namely his own
hand-writing, and that of his servant, who is now at Tripoli. In a
letter, dated Timbuctoo, September 21, 1826, addressed to the
Consul, Mr. Warrington, now lying before me, the Major says that he
arrived in this city on the 18th of the preceding month; that he
intended to quit it the day following the date of his letter, that
is to say, on the 22nd September and to proceed on the road to
Ségo: he then enters into many details relative to this city, and
gives a great number of curious documents which he had collected on
the subject, and other materials, which will without doubt be one
day published.</p>

<p>He accordingly left Timbuctoo, on the 22nd September, with a
small caravan, having only one Arab servant; on the third evening
he was joined by several Arabs belonging to the caravan, and
afterwards basely massacred. It happened that the above-mentioned
letter, written from Timbuctoo, was in the possession of his
servant. His baggage was entirely pillaged, and his journal and
numerous papers carried off; but we have still hopes that they will
be recovered. The servant has undergone the most rigorous
examination; he is firm and consistent in all his answers; and I
regret to say that there is great reason to suppose that this
enterprising traveller fell a victim to the traitorous and
barbarous Bello, who behaved so scandalously to Captain
Clapperton.</p>

<p>I therefore hope from your justice, as a man devoted to the
sciences, and particularly to geography, and as President of the
Central Committee, that you will give the same publicity to this
communication as has been given to the fortunate result of the
meritorious enterprise of M. Caillié.</p>

<p class="pad1">I have the honour to be,</p>

<p class="right">Sir,</p>

<p class="right">Your very obedient servant,</p>

<p class="right sc">John Barrow.</p>

<hr class="chap">

<h5><em>Extract from the Answer of</em> <span class="sc">M.
Jomard</span> <em>to</em> <span class="sc">Mr. Barrow</span>.</h5>

<p class="right">Paris, 31 October, 1828.</p>

<p class="pad1 sc">Sir,</p>

<p>Although a stranger to the letter which forms the subject of
your appeal, I should never consent to participate, even
indirectly, in an assertion contrary to truth, or to the reputation
of the courageous traveller, whose interests you justly defend. No
one is less accessible than myself to impressions exclusively
national, and it is on behalf of humanity in general that I am
devoted to the cause of science and its indefinite progress. I
should, therefore, have sincerely rejoiced in being the first to
make known in France the return and success of Major Laing, as I
was fortunate enough to do in regard to Captain Clapperton and
Major Denham on their arrival. You must be aware, Sir, that it was
I who announced to the French public the labours of these intrepid
adventurers, who first published their valuable Discoveries in
Central Africa, and paid legitimate homage to the memory of Dr.
Oudney. With respect to Major Laing, I long questioned and
withstood the premature rumours of his death, and exerted myself to
point out the contradictions that pervaded the accounts circulated
both in Africa and Europe; nothing, indeed, had yet persuaded me of
the reality of this catastrophe, and your letter alone, Sir, could
oblige me to give entire credit to this distressing intelligence,
so ardently did I desire to be informed of Major Laing’s success,
and to have the pleasure of proclaiming it, and of contributing,
however feebly, to his renown. Major Denham may have acquainted you
with the reception which he experienced from me at Paris; and told
you how happy I esteemed myself in embracing this brave officer,
and in conversing with a man who had ten times courageously
hazarded his life, in order to penetrate as far as possible in an
unknown continent.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, these are the very expressions which form the subject
of your appeal: “He (M. A. Caillié) is the only European who has
hitherto succeeded in happily accomplishing an enterprize in which
so many brave travellers have fallen.”</p>

<p>You see, Sir, that the matter in question is the fortunate
return of the traveller to his country, and not the discovery of
Timbuctoo. The merit of having first visited that city is not
ascribed to him. Thus, after the death of Dr. Oudney, his more
fortunate companions, Clapperton and Denham, again reached their
native land: it might then be said, on their return to England,
that they were the first Europeans who had come back from Bornou,
and brought this enterprise to a successful termination, and that
without detracting in the least from the Doctor’s wreath of glory.
You will then do justice, Sir, I make no doubt, not only to me, but
to M. Delaporte, Vice-Consul of France; and you will have no
difficulty in acknowledging, that no one has had any intention of
depriving your countrymen of the honour due to them. I take credit
to myself for having contributed to establish it as a principle in
the Geographical Society, that travellers of all nations are
equally entitled to its attention, that its rewards belong to all,
whatever may be their nation; in short, that there is no
distinction in the feelings of this Society towards foreigners and
denizens.</p>

<p>Permit me, Sir, to deplore with yourself the sad event related
in your letter; however, several circumstances appear still to
leave some small room for doubt; I hope my incredulity may be
justified by the event. But, if the catastrophe is certain, it is
yet devoutly to be wished that the journal of his travels may be
recovered, or that his servant may be able to furnish some
information that can be depended upon; also, that the curious
documents, which you mention as being in your possession, may be
published as soon as possible. We shall soon, I hope, be favoured
with the documents brought home by Clapperton’s servant, Lander,
and I shall not then be behind-hand in appreciating the merit of
this new victim to the cause of science. Allow me here, Sir, to add
one remark: had it devolved upon me to make a catalogue of the
Europeans who have reached the city of Timbuctoo, I should not have
overlooked several individuals who appear to have visited it; I
should even probably have mentioned Robert Adams, though his
travels have been called in question, and opinions, as you know,
are still divided upon them. Neither would M. Delaporte have failed
to cite them, had this been his object: but his intention was
simply to announce the fortunate return of the traveller, after
having crossed the Great Desert; a happiness neither reserved for
Hornemann, Park, Oudney, the unfortunate Laing, nor for so many
other lamented victims.</p>

<p>It only remains for me, Sir, to congratulate myself on the
opportunity you have afforded me for expressing my real sentiments
as to what should constitute the object of all geographical
discoveries, that is to say, usefulness and the increase of human
happiness. I am equally gratified in the opportunity of expressing
to you, individually, the high esteem which I profess for
scientific men and travellers of your nation. With these sentiments
I beg you to believe me, &amp;c.</p>

<p>M. Jomard gave notice that M. Auguste Caillié, present at the

announced that he had been able from the journal to draw a complete
itinerary from Rio-Nuñez to Tangier, by Timé, Jenné, Timbuctoo,
Tafilet, and Fez. He proposed that a committee of five members
should be appointed to take the papers into consideration and make
their report before the general meeting, in order that the public
may be speedily enabled to appreciate the labours and observations
of this interesting traveller. The proposition was unanimously
adopted, and a special commission composed of Messrs. Eyriès,
Amédée Jaubert, Larenaudière, baron Roger, Cadet de Metz, and
Jomard, appointed to report to the meeting upon the travels and

<p>M. Jomard, the organ of the Committee charged to draw up an
account of the results of M. Caillié’s travels, read the report,
which was listened to with the most lively and intense attention.
After having successively explained all the reasons upon which the
conviction of the Committee was founded, and especially the
agreement which subsists between the accounts of this traveller and
those published by such of his predecessors as are the most
accurate and most deserving of credit; after having announced that
M. Caillié’s journal contains an itinerary continued without
interruption from Rio-Nuñez to Tangier; the reporter delivered a
sketch of the results of the Travels sufficient to excite, but not
to satisfy the curiosity of the audience. He enumerated the
principal places which our countryman visited during a journey of
seventeen months, and of about three thousand miles. We shall only
cite his embarkation at Jenné on the Dhioliba (vulgarly called the
Niger), his navigation from thence to Timbuctoo, during an entire
month in the season of shallow water; his residence in this town,
and his subsequent journey across the great desert, during two
months and a half, to the kingdom of Morocco and to Tangier. There
M. Delaporte, Consul of France and a member of the Geographical
Society, received our countryman, lavished upon him all the
attentions which his ill-health and exhaustion demanded, after his
escape from the dangers of the climate and the perils of so long
and arduous a journey.</p>

<p>The report was warmly applauded; and, in conformity to the
conclusions of the Committee, M. Caillié was introduced, and
received from the hands of the President the recompense offered to
his generous self-devotion, that is to say, the produce of a
subscription opened by the Society in behalf of the person who
should first succeed in penetrating to Timbuctoo by the way of
Senegambia, and in furnishing a description of that town.</p>

Gadamès. From this town he went towards Touat, then he proceded
towards the tribe of the Cheykh Moctar (chief of the Kountas, to
the east of the kingdom of the Dowiches). In consideration of a
thousand drachms of gold, the people of this tribe accompanied him
to Timbuctoo, where they arrived after a journey which continued
seven days; afterwards they left him. This white man remained some
days at Timbuctoo; then he quitted it. He was met by the Moors who
are called Berabiches. These killed him, stole his money, and left
behind the books which he possessed.</p>

<p class="right">St. Louis, September, 1828.</p>

<p>On my way hither from my own country, I passed through
Timbuctoo, when I learnt that a white man, who had resided there
some days, had been murdered on his way to Ségo; and the
circumstances of that unfortunate event, as related to me, in that
town, are as follows:</p>

<p>This European, who came from Tripoli, and expressed a desire to
proceed to the Senegambia, travelled with a Jew of Barbary, who
acted as interpreter; he was attended by four black servants, and
possessed nine camels laden with provisions and merchandise. He had
arrived within a few days’ journey of Timbuctoo with his caravan,
when he was joined by another, composed of Moors of Tuat or
<i>Tuaris</i>. They first demanded presents of him, and then
invited him to barter. The Englishman (who is supposed to be Major
Laing) consented, and trafficked with this tribe: but, during the
night, they burst into his tent and attacked him. The white man and
his servants defended themselves bravely: though wounded in the
arm, the traveller succeeded in escaping on one of his camels: he
was rejoined soon after by one of the blacks, who brought back two
others; they fortunately reached Timbuctoo and took refuge there.
But the Tuaris pursued them, and required of the King to surrender
to them the white man who had killed several of their companions.
The unfortunate man was obliged to flee from his persecutors: in
vain he took a contrary course to deceive his pursuers and escape
to Ségo; he was overtaken by the villains and put to death.</p>

<p>I could have easily obtained from the Tuaris the books which
belonged to this European; but I durst not, lest I should be
suspected of having been concerned in his murder.</p>

results from the route of M. Caillié as traced by me, the positions

attention to the fact that M. Walckenaer had carried this position
at least two degrees farther west than the old maps. Subsequent
observations, which I have employed myself in collecting, have
proved that a change in this direction was necessary. To judge of
its extent it was essential to have good observations taken at
Galam, (or at Bakel), as well as a new itinerary between Senegambia
and the Dhioliba. It is on these more accurate data that I have
endeavoured to work.</p>

not only for the shelter it afforded him, but for the importance

that this is one of the portable articles which Europeans would be

three thousand horsemen under his command, and an almost
innumerable multitude of archers. One very remarkable circumstance
is that fire destroyed, according to this author, (if we read
<i>oppidi pars</i>) <i>almost half the city in the space of five
hours</i>. Leo’s recital is the most important, and perhaps the
most authentic, of any we have hitherto possessed. These motives
induce me to place it entire before the reader, in order that he
may compare it with the new narrative. I shall quote the Latin
version made from the Italian of Leo (2nd edition), though it is
not quite so accurate as might be wished: it is well known that Leo
wrote it originally in Arabic. See Joannis Leonis Africani de

<p>TUMBUTUM REGNUM.</p>

<p>Hujus regni nomen nostris ferè temporibus ab ejusdem nominis
oppido desumptum volunt, cujus conditorem fuisse dicunt quemdam
Mensè-Suleiman, hegiræ anno sexcentesimo decimo: in duodecimo

effluebat; cujus domus omnes in tuguriola cretacea<a id=

stramineis tectis sunt mutatæ. Visitur tamen elegantissimum quoddam
templum, cujus murus ex lapidibus atque calce vivo est fabricatus:
deindè et palatium quoddam regium à quodam Granatæ viro
artificiosissimo conditum. Frequentissimæ hìc sunt artificum,
mercatorum, præcipuè autem telæ atque gossypii textorum, officinæ.
Hùc mercatores barbari pannum ex Europâ afferunt. Hujus quoque
regionis mulieres faciem tegunt, ancillis tamen exceptis, iisque
quæ omnia ad victum necessaria vendunt. Incolæ, ac inter hos exteri
præsertim, sunt ditissimi, adeò ut qui jam regem agit, utramque
filiam duobus mercatoribus ditissimis in uxores dederit.
Frequentissimi hìc putei, qui aquam præbent dulcissimam; ac quoties
Niger flumen excrescit, ejus aquam ductibus quibusdam in urbem
trahunt. Regio est frumentis, pecudibus, lacte atque butyro
copiosissima: salis verò summa est penuria; hùc enim à Tegasa, quod
oppidum in quingentesimo abest milliario, adferri solet. Ego cùm
hìc essem, vidi salis sarcinam unam, quantùm camelus ferre potuit,
octoginta emi aureis. Tumbuti rex opulentissimus bracteas aliquot
atque sceptra habet, quorum nonnulla mille et trecentarum sunt
librarum. Magnificam optimèque instructam alit aulam: quoties
aliquò proficiscitur, camelo insidet, qui à nobilibus duci solet;
idem evenit quoties ad bellum proficiscitur; milites verò omnes
equites sunt. Hunc si quis regem alloqui velit, ad pedes primùm
procidit, deindè terram sumens in caput atque humeros sternit:
soletque hic fère mos ab illis servari, qui nunquam anteà regi sunt
locuti, aut qui ab alio principe hùc legati sunt missi. Equitum
semper tria millia habet, pedites propemodùm innumeros, qui arcubus
sagittas emittunt veneno infectas. Frequentissimè cum his
belligerantur, qui tributum persolvere recusant, et quotquot prælio
capere possunt, Tumbuti mercatoribus vendunt. Magna hìc est equorum
paucitas; mercatores atque aulici pusillos quosdam alunt, quibus in
itinere peragendo uti solent; præstantissimi autem equi à Barbaria
adducuntur; Rex verò simul atque audit mercatores cum equis
appulisse, mox numerum sibi adferri jubet, deindè omnium
præstantissimum sibi deligit, pretiumque liberalissime persolvit.
Judæis omnibus adeò se hostem atrocem præbet, ut nullos omninò in
ea civitate admittat: si quos Barbaros aliquid cum Judæis commercii
habere intelligit, statim illorum bona proscribere jubet. Magna hìc
est judicum, doctorum, sacerdotum, atque virorum doctissimorum,
copia, qui liberalissimis regiis aluntur stipendiis. Infiniti hìc
libri manuscripti ex Barbaria adferuntur; è quibus multò plures
pecuniæ quàm ex reliquiis omnibus mercibus colliguntur. Horum
moneta aurea est, nullis figuris insignita: in rebus autem
minutioribus cochleis quibusdam utuntur quæ hùc ex Persarum regione
convehi solent, harum quadringentæ aureo æquivalent: aureorum autem
sex, cum duabus unius aurei tertiis, unciam unam pendent. Homines
naturâ sunt mites atque placidi; à vigesimâ quartâ in primam usque
noctis horam cantando atque saltando omnes ferè civitatis partes
ambiunt. Mancipia utriusque sexûs quàm plurima alunt: estque
oppidum ignis injuriæ maximè obnoxium; ubi jàm secundùm ad hos
venissem dimidia ferè <i>oppida</i> pars quinque horarum spatio
igne deleta fuit. Nullum in suburbio hortum aut fructibus consitum
locum reperies.</p>

<p>CABRA OPPIDUM.</p>

<p>Cabra sic satis amplum absque muris ad pagi modum compositum
oppidum, distat à Tumbuto ad flumen Nigrum in duodecimo ferè
milliario; hìc mercatores ad Gineæ aut Melli regnum navigare
cupientes, naves conscendunt. Hujus tàm cives quàm ædificia Tumbuti
ædificiis atque civibus non admodùm sunt inferiora: hùc Nigritæ
navigio undique confluere solent. In hac civitate Tumbuti rex
judicem quemdam constituit, qui lites inter eos componeret:
molestum enim erat toties in anno eam ob causam eò proficisci. Ego
hìc regis fratrem Abu-Bacr, cognomine Pargama, novi hominem, colore
quidem nigrum, cæterùm animo atque ingenio candidissimum.
Frequentissimi hìc exoriuntur morbi, qui rempublicam mirum in modum
minuunt. Idque propter ciborum ineptissimam commixtionem: pisces
enim lacte, butyro atque carnibus commiscent; estque hic præcipuus
ferè Tumbuti cibus.</p>

opinion is developed at great length, and I should here insist upon
the merit of this explanation, had not the author prevented me, by

<p>It is to be regretted that travellers, when collecting the words
of an unknown language, do not select peculiar and characteristic
terms: it would be easier, by following this method of comparing
the different idioms, to discover their family resemblance or their
original dissimilarity. With this view, I have formed a rather
extended specimen of a vocabulary principally for the use of
travellers in Africa, with a methodic mode of interrogation (See
<i>Atlas Ethn. de M. Ad. Balbi</i>, page xlviij).</p>

<p>I have also formed a collection of vocabularies of more than
thirty idioms of Northern Africa, which may serve as a second part

words of the language spoken at Timbuctoo, according to Captain
Lyon and Major Denham: these last are accompanied by the letter D.;
it is remarkable that they are all confirmed by M. Caillié, and at
the same time scarcely one of the others. The words given by Robert
Adams to M. Dupuis are in the same predicament as those of Captain
Lyon. This disagreement alone cannot prove the falsity of the
travels of Adams; but it is at least well worthy of attention. See

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
